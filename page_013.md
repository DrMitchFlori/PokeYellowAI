## General Team Strategy

### Objective
Build and maintain a balanced team that can handle many different Pokémon types throughout the adventure.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Include a mix of physical-attack specialists and special-attack specialists.  
2. For early-game progression, use:  
   • Wartortle (Water)  
   • Pikachu (Electric)  
   • Pidgeotto (Flying)  
   • Diglett (Ground)  
   • Metapod (Bug, evolving into Butterfree)  
   • Rattata (Normal)  
3. As you reach mid- to late-game, transition to a stronger lineup:  
   • Blastoise (Water)  
   • Raichu (Electric)  
   • Machamp (Fighting)
   • Dugtrio (Ground)  
   • Flareon (Fire)  
   • Alakazam (Psychic)  
4. Keep your Pokémon at competitive levels to avoid being overpowered or too weak.  
5. Switch team members as needed if certain types pose a threat you cannot counter effectively.

### Decision Rules
• If you expect a specific opposing Pokémon type, reorder your party so a Pokémon with a type advantage is first.  
• If your active Pokémon is at risk of fainting, substitute immediately to prolong battle and capture opportunities.  
• When searching for new Pokémon to catch, consider using slightly weaker Pokémon to avoid accidentally defeating them before capture.

## Status Effects Strategy

### Objective
Apply and manage status conditions (Poison, Paralysis, Sleep, Burn, Freeze) to gain an advantage in battles.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Use status-inflicting moves (e.g., PoisonPowder, Thunder Wave, Sleep Powder) to immobilize or weaken targets.  
2. Follow up with strong attacks while the opposing Pokémon is affected and less likely to retaliate.  
3. Take advantage of status effects to make catching wild Pokémon easier.

### Decision Rules
• If you want to capture a wild Pokémon more easily, use Sleep or Paralysis moves before throwing a Poké Ball.  
• If the opposing Pokémon frequently uses special moves, apply Paralysis to reduce its chance to strike first.

## Stats and Attack Types

### Objective
Optimize physical and special moves based on your Pokémon’s Attack, Defense, Speed, and Special stats.

### Key Information
• Attack (Physical / “A Type”): Governs moves like Tackle, Bite, or Karate Chop.  
• Defense: Determines how well your Pokémon endures physical damage.  
• Speed: Higher Speed often allows attacking first in each turn.  
• Special (Special / “B Type”): Governs moves like Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, or Psychic and also your Pokémon’s special defense.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Lead with a fast Pokémon (high Speed) to strike quickly and gain an early advantage.  
2. If facing a strong physical attacker (e.g., Primeape), switch to a Pokémon with high Defense.  
3. If an opponent relies on special moves (e.g., Alakazam), use a Pokémon with a high Special stat for better resilience.  
4. Adjust your party order and moveset based on the type of attacks likely to be encountered.

### Decision Rules
• When encountering a Fighting-type Pokémon, prioritize high Defense teammates.  
• If you need quick knockouts, use fast attackers first, then pivot to bulkier teammates to finish the job.

## Type Categories (Reference)

A Type (Physical):  
• Flying  
• Bug  
• Normal  
• Ground  
• Ghost  
• Fighting  
• Rock  

B Type (Special):  
• Fire  
• Water  
• Ice  
• Electric  
• Poison  
• Psychic  
• Dragon  

Use these categories to determine which stat (Attack or Special) your moves rely on and which stat is most effective to boost or defend against.

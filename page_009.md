## General Evolution Mechanics

### Objective
- Understand how Pokémon evolve through experience, items, or trading.
- Learn how to manage experience distribution and newly learned abilities.
- Decide when to allow or cancel Pokémon evolution based on strategic value.

## Evolving Pokémon by Experience

### When Pokémon Gain Experience
1. Engage in battles against wild Pokémon or Trainers.
2. Distribute experience points to all Pokémon that actively participate.
   - Example: If defeating a wild Pidgey grants 22 EXP, and only one of your Pokémon participated, it earns all 22 EXP. If two fought, each receives 11 EXP, and so on.
3. Track total experience to determine when a Pokémon levels up.

### Decision Rules for Higher-Level Foes
- If encountering a tougher opponent (e.g., higher-level Pokémon or strong Trainers), defeating them grants more EXP.
- When a battle looks challenging, consider using multiple Pokémon to share the EXP and ensure victory.

## Abilities and Managing Moves

### When a Pokémon Levels Up
1. Check if the Pokémon can learn a new move at that level.
2. If the Pokémon already knows four moves, decide which move to overwrite.
3. Use Technical Machines (TM) or Hidden Machines (HM) to teach additional moves when available.

#### Decision Rule
- If you plan to use a specific competitive move set, override less useful moves or hold off on learning a new move until it suits your strategy.

## Evolution via Leveling

### When Pokémon Evolve
1. Most Pokémon evolve automatically upon reaching certain levels (e.g., Rattata evolves into Raticate, Spearow evolves into Fearow).
2. Evolution boosts stats and changes the Pokémon’s form.
3. Gaining new Pokédex entries counts as having caught an additional Pokémon.

#### Decision Rule
- If you want a Pokémon to learn certain moves earlier, consider delaying evolution by pressing B during the evolution animation. This only works for Pokémon evolving via level-up.
- If you value immediate stat boosts over potential early-learned moves, allow the evolution to complete.

---

## Evolution via Items or Trading

### When Items Are Required
1. Some Pokémon require a specific Evolutionary Stone (e.g., Thunder Stone, Fire Stone) to evolve.
2. Use the item on the Pokémon from your inventory menu to trigger instant evolution.

### When Trading Is Needed
1. Certain Pokémon (e.g., Haunter, Machoke) evolve upon being traded.
2. Complete the trade to trigger evolution. Then trade back if you wish to keep the evolved form.

#### Decision Rule
- If your goal is to complete the Pokédex, arrange trades with an in-game partner or another player.
- Only use rare Evolutionary Stones on Pokémon that match your team strategy or to fill a Pokédex entry efficiently.

## Key Information
- Pokémon types: Determine which battles maximize advantageous matchups for faster EXP gain.
- Experience levels: Familiarize yourself with the exact levels at which each Pokémon evolves or learns crucial moves.
- Items: Technical Machines (TM), Hidden Machines (HM), and Evolutionary Stones are keys to unlocking new moves or evolutions.
- Cancelling evolution: Press B to halt evolution only if you aim for a specific move learned earlier by the unevolved form.
- Screenshot cues: Look for on-screen prompts such as “What? SPEAROW is evolving!” or messages when a Pokémon tries to learn a new move.

Use these guidelines to decide when to battle, when to evolve or cancel evolution, and how to manage your team for optimal progression in Pokémon Yellow.

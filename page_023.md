## Mt. Moon – Overview
**Objective**: Traverse Mt. Moon’s floors to collect items, train your team, and potentially catch rare Pokémon like Clefairy.  
**Key Information**:  
- Mt. Moon has three levels (First Floor, First Basement, Second Basement).  
- Rare Pokémon: Clefairy (#35).  
- Useful items: Potions, Rare Candy, Escape Rope, Moon Stone, Ether.

## Mt. Moon – First Floor
**Objective**: Explore and gather initial items; begin searching for Clefairy.  
1. Look for these Pokémon:  
   - Sandshrew (#27, Ground)  
   - Clefairy (#35, Normal) – rare encounter  
   - Zubat (#41, Poison/Flying)  
   - Paras (#46, Bug/Grass)  
   - Geodude (#74, Rock/Ground)  
2. Collect available items along this floor:  
   - Potion  
   - Rare Candy  
   - Escape Rope  
   - Moon Stone  
3. When you see a Clefairy, consider catching it because Clefairy is only found here and one other location outside Mt. Moon.  

**Decision Rule**:  
- When you encounter Clefairy and want future Normal-type coverage, use Poké Balls to capture it immediately, as Clefairy is uncommon and evolves into Clefable (which cannot learn new moves naturally).

## Mt. Moon – First Basement
**Objective**: Deepen your search for Clefairy or train other Pokémon; locate hidden items.  
1. Expected Pokémon encounters:  
   - Clefairy (#35, Normal) – still few  
   - Zubat (#41, Poison/Flying) – many  
   - Paras (#46, Bug/Grass) – few  
   - Geodude (#74, Rock/Ground) – many  
2. If you need more chances for Clefairy, linger here; the encounter rate may be slightly better than the upper floor for certain Pokémon.  

**Decision Rule**:  
- When your Pokémon are low on HP or you run out of items, use an Escape Rope or return to the Pokémon Center before proceeding, to ensure your team stays healthy.

## Mt. Moon – Second Basement
**Objective**: Acquire Fossils and complete your traversal of Mt. Moon.  
1. Expected Pokémon encounters:  
   - Clefairy (#35, Normal) – still possible  
   - Zubat (#41, Poison/Flying)  
   - Paras (#46, Bug/Grass)  
   - Geodude (#74, Rock/Ground) – many  
2. Walk to the left side of the prominent rock formation and press “A” to discover an Ether (restores 10 PP to one move).  
3. Prepare for Fossil collection and potential battles with Trainers who guard them.  

**Decision Rule**:  
- When planning to evolve Clefairy into Clefable, remember Clefable cannot learn additional moves by leveling up, so teach all desired moves to Clefairy first.  

---

## Route 3
**Objective**: Train and catch new Pokémon before entering Mt. Moon.  
1. Pokémon availability here is generally lower variety compared to Mt. Moon.  
2. Use this area to raise weaker team members before facing Mt. Moon challenges.  

**Decision Rule**:  
- If your team is under-leveled, then stay on Route 3 to battle wild Pokémon until you feel comfortable tackling Trainers inside Mt. Moon.  

---

## Route 4
**Objective**: Exit Mt. Moon and move toward Cerulean City.  
1. Mostly a transition route with fewer Pokémon encounters.  
2. Use the Pokémon Center if needed before heading east.  

**Decision Rule**:  
- When you exit Mt. Moon and find yourself on Route 4, then rest at the nearby Pokémon Center if resources are low.

## Key Strategy Notes
1. Clefairy Rarity:  
   - If you spot Clefairy, catch it early; it’s rare outside Mt. Moon.  
   - Once evolved into Clefable, rely on TMs/HMs for new moves.  
2. Zubat’s Leech Life:  
   - When Zubat uses Leech Life, your Pokémon’s HP will be drained; consider switching to a resistant type or healing promptly.  
3. Paras’s Stun Spore:  
   - If Paras uses Stun Spore, you risk being paralyzed. Carry Paralyze Heals.  
4. Geodude’s Rock/Ground Type:  
   - When facing Geodude, use Water, Grass, or Fighting moves for effectiveness.  
5. Item Management:  
   - Keep a Potion or two for mid-dungeon heals.  
   - Moon Stone evolves certain Pokémon (like Clefairy into Clefable).  
   - Ether helps when you run low on PP during long dungeon exploration.  

Use this guidance to navigate Mt. Moon effectively, manage your team’s health, capture rare Pokémon, and advance closer to Cerulean City.

## Cable Club (Pokémon Center)

### Objective
- Use the Game Link Cable to trade Pokémon or battle against another player.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Go to the nearest Pokémon Center with both Game Boy systems.  
2. Enter the Cable Club area (ask the attendant at the Cable Club counter).  
3. Decide on your activity:  
   - Trade Pokémon  
   - Battle another player  
4. If the connection fails:  
   - Keep both Game Boys linked  
   - Turn both systems off  
   - Turn both systems on  
   - Attempt to connect again  

### Decision Rules
- If you want to trade for Pokémon unavailable in your version of the game, then coordinate with a player who has those exclusive Pokémon.  
- When a Pokémon is traded to you, it gains 1.5× more experience in future battles.  
- If you need to evolve Machoke, Haunter, or Graveler into Machamp, Gengar, or Golem, respectively, then perform a trade (these evolutions only occur through trading).  
- If a Pokémon refuses to obey in battle, then check your Gym Badges—Pokémon above a certain level will only obey if you have the appropriate League Badge.  

### Key Information
- Traded Pokémon gain extra experience (1.5× normal rate).  
- You cannot earn experience or catch Pokémon in a Cable Club battle.  
- Pokémon must be traded one-for-one; you cannot simply give a Pokémon away.  
- Common Pokémon for you might be rare for another player—use this to your advantage when negotiating trades.  
- Some NPCs in the game also offer trades; if you detect an opportunity for a rare or evolved Pokémon, consider trading with them.  

### Trading-Only Evolutions
- Machoke (No. 67) → Machamp (No. 68)  
- Graveler (No. 75) → Golem (No. 76)  
- Haunter (No. 93) → Gengar (No. 94)

## Grassy Encounters
**Objective:** Find and capture wild Pokémon in tall grass.  
**Situation:** When walking through grassy areas, wild Pokémon may appear.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Walk into a grassy area until a wild Pokémon challenges you.  
2. Assess the Pokémon’s type, level, and remaining HP.  
3. Decide whether you want to battle or capture:
   - If you want to capture, plan to reduce its HP without knocking it out.
   - If the Pokémon is too strong, consider using a status-afflicting move (e.g., sleep or paralysis) to increase capture success.
4. Use a Poké Ball item if the Pokémon’s HP is low enough:
   - If it breaks free, weaken it further or try another Poké Ball.
5. If you do not need to capture it:
   - Defeat it to gain experience, or run if you wish to avoid conflict.

### Decision Rules
- **When** the wild Pokémon’s HP is high, **then** keep attacking (but not enough to make it faint).  
- **When** the Pokémon is near low HP, **then** throw a Poké Ball.  
- **If** your Pokémon is at risk of fainting, **then** consider healing or switching out.  

### Key Information
- You cannot capture another Trainer’s Pokémon—only wild Pokémon.  
- Standard Poké Balls may not work as well on higher-level Pokémon; consider upgrading to Great Balls, Ultra Balls, or the Master Ball.

## Fishing Encounters
**Objective:** Locate and capture water-dwelling Pokémon using fishing rods.  
**Situation:** Certain Pokémon appear only in bodies of water when using specific rods.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Stand at the edge of a body of water (river, lake, sea).  
2. Select a fishing rod from your inventory (Old Rod, Good Rod, or Super Rod).  
3. Wait for a bite; if a Pokémon appears, you will enter a battle screen.  
4. Follow the same capture procedure as with grassy encounters:
   - Reduce HP, apply status effects if possible, then throw a Poké Ball.  

### Decision Rules
- **When** you have a more advanced rod (Good or Super), **then** you can encounter stronger or rarer Pokémon.  
- **If** you fail to capture a Pokémon, **then** fish again or return with stronger Pokémon for a better chance.  

### Key Information
- Different rods yield different Pokémon species and levels.  
- Fishing spots often host water-type Pokémon you won’t find on land.

## Combat and Capture Mechanics
**Objective:** Secure wild Pokémon without making them faint.  
**Situation:** Each wild encounter transitions to the battle screen automatically.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Check the wild Pokémon’s type and level relative to your party’s strength.  
2. Use attacks carefully to bring its HP down to a safe point:
   - Avoid using moves likely to knock it out completely if you intend to capture.  
3. Apply status conditions (sleep, paralysis, etc.) to improve catch rates.  
4. Throw the appropriate Poké Ball:
   - Poké Ball: Basic option for weak or low-level Pokémon.  
   - Great Ball: Better success rate for mid-level Pokémon.  
   - Ultra Ball: High success rate for stronger Pokémon.  
   - Master Ball: 100% catch rate; only one is available in the entire game—save it for a rare or legendary Pokémon.  

### Decision Rules
- **When** a Pokémon’s HP is fully depleted, **then** you cannot capture it (it faints).  
- **If** the Pokémon breaks free repeatedly, **then** use stronger Poké Balls or inflict a status ailment.  

### Key Information
- Higher-level Pokémon require better Poké Balls and strategic planning to catch.  
- The Master Ball should be reserved for extremely rare encounters due to its limited availability.

## Carrying and Storing Pokémon
**Objective:** Manage your party to ensure you have space for new captures.  
**Situation:** You can carry a maximum of six Pokémon in your party.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Check your party slots before attempting new captures.  
2. If your party is full, captured Pokémon will be automatically sent to the PC storage system.  
3. Visit a Pokémon Center to access the PC if you need to swap party members.  
4. Use the Pokédex to review stats, types, and moves of both party and stored Pokémon.  

### Decision Rules
- **When** your party is full, **then** newly captured Pokémon go directly to storage.  
- **If** you need a certain Pokémon for a specific strategy or upcoming area, **then** use the PC to retrieve it from storage.  

### Key Information
- The Pokédex provides critical data (height, weight, type, moves) for planning strategies.  
- Regularly update your party to keep it balanced for upcoming battles and encounters.

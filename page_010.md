## Evolving Pokémon with Stones

### Objective
Obtain and use the correct elemental stones to evolve specific Pokémon. Increase your party’s strength and fill your Pokédex efficiently.

### Key Information
- Elemental Stones: Fire Stone, Water Stone, Thunder Stone, Moon Stone
- Common Source: Celadon Department Store (can purchase most elemental stones here)

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Identify Pokémon in your party that require a stone-based evolution (e.g., Vulpix, Growlithe, Eevee, Shellder).  
2. Travel to Celadon City.  
3. Enter the Celadon Department Store.  
4. Buy the necessary elemental stone(s):  
   - Fire Stone (for Vulpix, Growlithe, and Eevee → Flareon)  
   - Water Stone (for Poliwhirl, Shellder, and Eevee → Vaporeon)  
   - Thunder Stone (for Pikachu and Eevee → Jolteon)  
   - Moon Stone (for Nidorina, Nidorino, Clefairy, Jigglypuff)  
5. Use the stone from your inventory on the corresponding Pokémon.  
   - Example: When you want Pikachu to evolve, then use the Thunder Stone on Pikachu.  
6. Confirm the evolution and add newly evolved Pokémon data to your Pokédex.

### Decision Rules
- If you do not have enough money, then defeat more Trainers or sell items to afford the stones.  
- If the evolved Pokémon learns new moves at later levels, then consider delaying evolution until it learns the move set you prefer.

## Evolving Pokémon by Trading

### Objective
Execute trades so that Pokémon that require trading for evolution can reach their evolved forms.

### Key Information
- Trading Trigger: Certain Pokémon (e.g., Machoke, Haunter) only evolve when traded.  
- Ownership Transfer: After trading, the Pokémon remains on the recipient’s game.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Identify Pokémon in your party that require a trade-based evolution (e.g., Machoke, Haunter).  
2. Arrange a trading session with another player or a trading link (if available).  
3. Initiate the trade process for the specific Pokémon.  
4. Complete the trade to trigger the evolution.  
5. (Optional) Trade back if you want your newly evolved Pokémon returned.

### Decision Rules
- If you want to keep your evolved Pokémon, then ensure the other player agrees to trade it back.  
- If you have no access to a second game or trading partner, then plan around in-game trades with NPCs (though these may not always trigger evolutions for the same Pokémon).

## Experience Gain from Traditions

### Objective
Maximize experience gains by trading Pokémon.

### Key Information
- Reward for Traded Pokémon: They earn extra EXP in battles.  
- Strategic Value: Trade a Pokémon early to benefit from faster leveling.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Decide which Pokémon you can afford to trade without losing progress (e.g., use duplicates).  
2. Trade Pokémon with another player or in-game character.  
3. Use your traded Pokémon in battles to level faster.  
4. Track your party’s EXP rates to ensure overall team balance.

### Decision Rules
- If your Pokémon lags behind in levels, then consider trading it to boost its EXP growth.  
- If your focus is on completing the Pokédex, then trade strategically to evolve Pokémon sooner.

## Location / Situation: Celadon Department Store

### Objective
Purchase stones for evolutions.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Enter the Celadon Department Store.  
2. Go to the evolution items counter (typically on the 4th floor).  
3. Buy the required stones (Fire, Water, Thunder, Moon).  
4. Check your party for Pokémon that evolve by those stones.  

### Decision Rules
- If you lack funds, then battle Trainers on Routes around Celadon or sell inessential items for money.  
- If you have extras, then store them in the PC to save space.

## Location / Situation: Trade Centers

### Objective
Initiate trades for evolution.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Access the Cable Club in any Pokémon Center (if applicable) or use a trading device.  
2. Connect with a friend’s game or use an in-game NPC trade if it’s for the desired Pokémon.  
3. Select the Pokémon that evolves by trade (Machoke, Haunter, etc.).  
4. Complete the trade to trigger evolution.  

### Decision Rules
- If you want the evolved Pokémon in your own roster, then trade back after evolution.  
- If the NPC’s Pokémon benefits your team, then compare stats before trading.

## Summary of Effectiveness
- Elemental Stone evolutions: Provide immediate stat boosts and new move sets.  
- Trade evolutions: Often result in high-stat Pokémon (e.g., Machamp, Gengar).  
- Extra EXP for traded Pokémon: Useful if you want to level quickly.

Use this structured approach to evolve your Pokémon efficiently, maximize their power, and work toward completing your Pokédex in Pokémon Yellow.

## General Pokémon Mechanics
### Objective
• Build strong bonds with Pokémon.  
• Use proper tactics in battle to ensure victory.  

### Key Information
• There are 150 different Pokémon, each with unique stats and potential.  
• Pokémon will disobey if they are too high-level for an inexperienced trainer.  
• You must collect Gym Badges to prove your skill and gain higher-level Pokémon’s obedience.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Capture or receive a Pokémon to begin your journey.  
2. Train your Pokémon by battling wild Pokémon and rival trainers.  
3. Earn Gym Badges to increase the level of Pokémon that will obey you.  

### Decision Rules
• WHEN a Pokémon refuses to follow orders, THEN focus on gaining more experience or badges before using it again.  
• WHEN considering which Pokémon to raise, THEN choose one that matches your badge-based obedience level.  


## Hit Points (HP) Management
### Objective
• Keep your Pokémon healthy so they can continue battling.  

### Key Information
• HP measures a Pokémon’s health.  
• When HP reaches zero, a Pokémon faints and cannot battle.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Monitor your Pokémon’s HP bar during each battle.  
2. Use healing items (Potion, Super Potion, etc.) as soon as HP becomes dangerously low.  
3. If a Pokémon faints (HP = 0), revive it with a Revive item or by visiting a Pokémon Center.  

### Decision Rules
• WHEN HP is below 20% in battle, THEN use a healing item or switch to another Pokémon.  
• WHEN a Pokémon faints, THEN visit a Pokémon Center or use a Revival item to continue battling.  


## Power Points (PP) Management
### Objective
• Maintain enough PP for each move to avoid being defenseless.  

### Key Information
• PP measures how many times each move can be used.  
• Using an attack or defensive move consumes 1 PP.  
• Struggle is used automatically if PP for all moves is exhausted.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Check PP levels before and after each battle.  
2. Replenish PP with Ethers or Elixirs, or by visiting a Pokémon Center.  
3. If all moves lose PP, use the FIGHT command to trigger Struggle.  

### Decision Rules
• WHEN a move’s PP is nearly depleted, THEN conserve it for crucial moments or restore it with items.  
• WHEN all moves have 0 PP, THEN Struggle is used automatically, dealing recoil damage—heal or restore PP quickly.  


## Attack Variety & Strategy
### Objective
• Develop a balanced moveset to handle different battle situations.  

### Key Information
• Pokémon can know up to four attacks at once.  
• Overreliance on one move may leave you without PP at key moments.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Teach a mix of moves (physical, special, status) to cover multiple opponent types.  
2. Regularly review each move’s PP usage and effectiveness.  
3. Replace outdated or less effective moves with TMs or by leveling up.  

### Decision Rules
• WHEN deciding which move to use, THEN consider type effectiveness, remaining PP, and possible side effects.  
• WHEN prompted to replace a move, THEN compare PP and power before deciding.  


## Special Attacks & Side Effects
### Objective
• Understand and leverage special attacks that can alter battle conditions.  

### Key Information
• Pokémon have four main stats: Attack, Defense, Speed, and Special.  
• Some attacks (e.g., Bubble) may reduce the opponent’s Speed.  
• Certain status moves (e.g., Confusion) can debilitate foes without direct damage.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Identify each move’s category (Normal, Special, or Status).  
2. Use Special attacks for potential extra effects (lower Speed, inflict status, etc.).  
3. Follow up with complementary moves to exploit the status changes.  

### Decision Rules
• WHEN facing a tough opponent, THEN try a move that causes a status effect before attacking directly.  
• WHEN an enemy is already afflicted by a status, THEN capitalize on the opening with a powerful attack.  


## Status Conditions
### Objective
• Prevent or cure negative status ailments to keep Pokémon battling effectively.  

### Key Information
• Poison, Burn, Paralysis, Sleep, and Freeze can persist after battle.  
• These conditions reduce effectiveness until cured or treated at a Pokémon Center.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Check your Pokémon’s status at the end of every battle.  
2. If a Pokémon is Poisoned, Paralyzed, etc., use items (Antidote, Paralyz Heal) or visit a Pokémon Center immediately.  
3. Monitor HP carefully, as Poison drains HP even outside of battle.  

### Decision Rules
• WHEN your Pokémon is poisoned, THEN use an Antidote or reach a Pokémon Center quickly to avoid fainting.  
• WHEN your Pokémon is burned or paralyzed, THEN decide if you have the items to cure it or if you should retreat to a Pokémon Center.  


## Trainer Authority & Badge Progress
### Objective
• Increase Pokémon obedience by earning Gym Badges.  

### Key Information
• Higher-level Pokémon may ignore a novice trainer’s commands.  
• Each Gym Badge raises the level cap at which Pokémon will obey.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Challenge Gym Leaders in order, starting with the first Gym.  
2. Train Pokémon to a level just sufficient to overcome the Gym Leader’s team.  
3. Earn each Badge to raise your obedience threshold for higher-level Pokémon.  

### Decision Rules
• WHEN a Pokémon refuses to attack, THEN check your current badge count or reduce the Pokémon’s level difference.  
• WHEN you earn a new Badge, THEN confirm your new obedience level and reintroduce any high-level Pokémon to battle.

## Grassy Encounters
**Objective:** Find and capture wild Pokémon in tall grass.  
**Situation:** When walking through grassy areas, wild Pokémon may appear.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Walk into a grassy area until a wild Pokémon challenges you.  
2. Assess the Pokémon’s type, level, and remaining HP.  
3. Decide whether you want to battle or capture:
   - If you want to capture, plan to reduce its HP without knocking it out.
   - If the Pokémon is too strong, consider using a status-afflicting move (e.g., sleep or paralysis) to increase capture success.
4. Use a Poké Ball item if the Pokémon’s HP is low enough:
   - If it breaks free, weaken it further or try another Poké Ball.
5. If you do not need to capture it:
   - Defeat it to gain experience, or run if you wish to avoid conflict.

### Decision Rules
- **When** the wild Pokémon’s HP is high, **then** keep attacking (but not enough to make it faint).  
- **When** the Pokémon is near low HP, **then** throw a Poké Ball.  
- **If** your Pokémon is at risk of fainting, **then** consider healing or switching out.  

### Key Information
- You cannot capture another Trainer’s Pokémon—only wild Pokémon.  
- Standard Poké Balls may not work as well on higher-level Pokémon; consider upgrading to Great Balls, Ultra Balls, or the Master Ball.  

---

## Fishing Encounters
**Objective:** Locate and capture water-dwelling Pokémon using fishing rods.  
**Situation:** Certain Pokémon appear only in bodies of water when using specific rods.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Stand at the edge of a body of water (river, lake, sea).  
2. Select a fishing rod from your inventory (Old Rod, Good Rod, or Super Rod).  
3. Wait for a bite; if a Pokémon appears, you will enter a battle screen.  
4. Follow the same capture procedure as with grassy encounters:
   - Reduce HP, apply status effects if possible, then throw a Poké Ball.  

### Decision Rules
- **When** you have a more advanced rod (Good or Super), **then** you can encounter stronger or rarer Pokémon.  
- **If** you fail to capture a Pokémon, **then** fish again or return with stronger Pokémon for a better chance.  

### Key Information
- Different rods yield different Pokémon species and levels.  
- Fishing spots often host water-type Pokémon you won’t find on land.  

---

## Combat and Capture Mechanics
**Objective:** Secure wild Pokémon without making them faint.  
**Situation:** Each wild encounter transitions to the battle screen automatically.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Check the wild Pokémon’s type and level relative to your party’s strength.  
2. Use attacks carefully to bring its HP down to a safe point:
   - Avoid using moves likely to knock it out completely if you intend to capture.  
3. Apply status conditions (sleep, paralysis, etc.) to improve catch rates.  
4. Throw the appropriate Poké Ball:
   - Poké Ball: Basic option for weak or low-level Pokémon.  
   - Great Ball: Better success rate for mid-level Pokémon.  
   - Ultra Ball: High success rate for stronger Pokémon.  
   - Master Ball: 100% catch rate; only one is available in the entire game—save it for a rare or legendary Pokémon.  

### Decision Rules
- **When** a Pokémon’s HP is fully depleted, **then** you cannot capture it (it faints).  
- **If** the Pokémon breaks free repeatedly, **then** use stronger Poké Balls or inflict a status ailment.  

### Key Information
- Higher-level Pokémon require better Poké Balls and strategic planning to catch.  
- The Master Ball should be reserved for extremely rare encounters due to its limited availability.  

---

## Carrying and Storing Pokémon
**Objective:** Manage your party to ensure you have space for new captures.  
**Situation:** You can carry a maximum of six Pokémon in your party.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Check your party slots before attempting new captures.  
2. If your party is full, captured Pokémon will be automatically sent to the PC storage system.  
3. Visit a Pokémon Center to access the PC if you need to swap party members.  
4. Use the Pokédex to review stats, types, and moves of both party and stored Pokémon.  

### Decision Rules
- **When** your party is full, **then** newly captured Pokémon go directly to storage.  
- **If** you need a certain Pokémon for a specific strategy or upcoming area, **then** use the PC to retrieve it from storage.  

### Key Information
- The Pokédex provides critical data (height, weight, type, moves) for planning strategies.  
- Regularly update your party to keep it balanced for upcoming battles and encounters.

## General Evolution Mechanics

### Objective
- Understand how Pokémon evolve through experience, items, or trading.
- Learn how to manage experience distribution and newly learned abilities.
- Decide when to allow or cancel Pokémon evolution based on strategic value.

---

## Evolving Pokémon by Experience

### When Pokémon Gain Experience
1. Engage in battles against wild Pokémon or Trainers.
2. Distribute experience points to all Pokémon that actively participate.
   - Example: If defeating a wild Pidgey grants 22 EXP, and only one of your Pokémon participated, it earns all 22 EXP. If two fought, each receives 11 EXP, and so on.
3. Track total experience to determine when a Pokémon levels up.

### Decision Rules for Higher-Level Foes
- If encountering a tougher opponent (e.g., higher-level Pokémon or strong Trainers), defeating them grants more EXP.
- When a battle looks challenging, consider using multiple Pokémon to share the EXP and ensure victory.

---

## Abilities and Managing Moves

### When a Pokémon Levels Up
1. Check if the Pokémon can learn a new move at that level.
2. If the Pokémon already knows four moves, decide which move to overwrite.
3. Use Technical Machines (TM) or Hidden Machines (HM) to teach additional moves when available.

#### Decision Rule
- If you plan to use a specific competitive move set, override less useful moves or hold off on learning a new move until it suits your strategy.

---

## Evolution via Leveling

### When Pokémon Evolve
1. Most Pokémon evolve automatically upon reaching certain levels (e.g., Rattata evolves into Raticate, Spearow evolves into Fearow).
2. Evolution boosts stats and changes the Pokémon’s form.
3. Gaining new Pokédex entries counts as having caught an additional Pokémon.

#### Decision Rule
- If you want a Pokémon to learn certain moves earlier, consider delaying evolution by pressing B during the evolution animation. This only works for Pokémon evolving via level-up.
- If you value immediate stat boosts over potential early-learned moves, allow the evolution to complete.

---

## Evolution via Items or Trading

### When Items Are Required
1. Some Pokémon require a specific Evolutionary Stone (e.g., Thunder Stone, Fire Stone) to evolve.
2. Use the item on the Pokémon from your inventory menu to trigger instant evolution.

### When Trading Is Needed
1. Certain Pokémon (e.g., Haunter, Machoke) evolve upon being traded.
2. Complete the trade to trigger evolution. Then trade back if you wish to keep the evolved form.

#### Decision Rule
- If your goal is to complete the Pokédex, arrange trades with an in-game partner or another player.
- Only use rare Evolutionary Stones on Pokémon that match your team strategy or to fill a Pokédex entry efficiently.

---

## Key Information
- Pokémon types: Determine which battles maximize advantageous matchups for faster EXP gain.
- Experience levels: Familiarize yourself with the exact levels at which each Pokémon evolves or learns crucial moves.
- Items: Technical Machines (TM), Hidden Machines (HM), and Evolutionary Stones are keys to unlocking new moves or evolutions.
- Cancelling evolution: Press B to halt evolution only if you aim for a specific move learned earlier by the unevolved form.
- Screenshot cues: Look for on-screen prompts such as “What? SPEAROW is evolving!” or messages when a Pokémon tries to learn a new move.

Use these guidelines to decide when to battle, when to evolve or cancel evolution, and how to manage your team for optimal progression in Pokémon Yellow.

## Evolving Pokémon with Stones

### Objective
Obtain and use the correct elemental stones to evolve specific Pokémon. Increase your party’s strength and fill your Pokédex efficiently.

### Key Information
- Elemental Stones: Fire Stone, Water Stone, Thunder Stone, Moon Stone
- Common Source: Celadon Department Store (can purchase most elemental stones here)

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Identify Pokémon in your party that require a stone-based evolution (e.g., Vulpix, Growlithe, Eevee, Shellder).  
2. Travel to Celadon City.  
3. Enter the Celadon Department Store.  
4. Buy the necessary elemental stone(s):  
   - Fire Stone (for Vulpix, Growlithe, and Eevee → Flareon)  
   - Water Stone (for Poliwhirl, Shellder, and Eevee → Vaporeon)  
   - Thunder Stone (for Pikachu and Eevee → Jolteon)  
   - Moon Stone (for Nidorina, Nidorino, Clefairy, Jigglypuff)  
5. Use the stone from your inventory on the corresponding Pokémon.  
   - Example: When you want Pikachu to evolve, then use the Thunder Stone on Pikachu.  
6. Confirm the evolution and add newly evolved Pokémon data to your Pokédex.

### Decision Rules
- If you do not have enough money, then defeat more Trainers or sell items to afford the stones.  
- If the evolved Pokémon learns new moves at later levels, then consider delaying evolution until it learns the move set you prefer.  

### Stone Evolution Reference
• Fire Stone → Vulpix → Ninetales, Growlithe → Arcanine, Eevee → Flareon  
• Water Stone → Poliwhirl → Poliwrath, Shellder → Cloyster, Eevee → Vaporeon  
• Thunder Stone → Pikachu → Raichu, Eevee → Jolteon  
• Moon Stone → Nidorina → Nidoqueen, Nidorino → Nidoking, Clefairy → Clefable, Jigglypuff → Wigglytuff  

---

## Evolving Pokémon by Trading

### Objective
Execute trades so that Pokémon that require trading for evolution can reach their evolved forms.

### Key Information
- Trading Trigger: Certain Pokémon (e.g., Machoke, Haunter) only evolve when traded.  
- Ownership Transfer: After trading, the Pokémon remains on the recipient’s game.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Identify Pokémon in your party that require a trade-based evolution (e.g., Machoke, Haunter).  
2. Arrange a trading session with another player or a trading link (if available).  
3. Initiate the trade process for the specific Pokémon.  
4. Complete the trade to trigger the evolution.  
5. (Optional) Trade back if you want your newly evolved Pokémon returned.

### Decision Rules
- If you want to keep your evolved Pokémon, then ensure the other player agrees to trade it back.  
- If you have no access to a second game or trading partner, then plan around in-game trades with NPCs (though these may not always trigger evolutions for the same Pokémon).

---

## Experience Gain from Traditions

### Objective
Maximize experience gains by trading Pokémon.

### Key Information
- Reward for Traded Pokémon: They earn extra EXP in battles.  
- Strategic Value: Trade a Pokémon early to benefit from faster leveling.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Decide which Pokémon you can afford to trade without losing progress (e.g., use duplicates).  
2. Trade Pokémon with another player or in-game character.  
3. Use your traded Pokémon in battles to level faster.  
4. Track your party’s EXP rates to ensure overall team balance.

### Decision Rules
- If your Pokémon lags behind in levels, then consider trading it to boost its EXP growth.  
- If your focus is on completing the Pokédex, then trade strategically to evolve Pokémon sooner.

---

## Location / Situation: Celadon Department Store

### Objective
Purchase stones for evolutions.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Enter the Celadon Department Store.  
2. Go to the evolution items counter (typically on the 4th floor).  
3. Buy the required stones (Fire, Water, Thunder, Moon).  
4. Check your party for Pokémon that evolve by those stones.  

### Decision Rules
- If you lack funds, then battle Trainers on Routes around Celadon or sell inessential items for money.  
- If you have extras, then store them in the PC to save space.

---

## Location / Situation: Trade Centers

### Objective
Initiate trades for evolution.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Access the Cable Club in any Pokémon Center (if applicable) or use a trading device.  
2. Connect with a friend’s game or use an in-game NPC trade if it’s for the desired Pokémon.  
3. Select the Pokémon that evolves by trade (Machoke, Haunter, etc.).  
4. Complete the trade to trigger evolution.  

### Decision Rules
- If you want the evolved Pokémon in your own roster, then trade back after evolution.  
- If the NPC’s Pokémon benefits your team, then compare stats before trading.

---

## Summary of Effectiveness
- Elemental Stone evolutions: Provide immediate stat boosts and new move sets.  
- Trade evolutions: Often result in high-stat Pokémon (e.g., Machamp, Gengar).  
- Extra EXP for traded Pokémon: Useful if you want to level quickly.

Use this structured approach to evolve your Pokémon efficiently, maximize their power, and work toward completing your Pokédex in Pokémon Yellow.

## Cable Club (Pokémon Center)

### Objective
- Use the Game Link Cable to trade Pokémon or battle against another player.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Go to the nearest Pokémon Center with both Game Boy systems.  
2. Enter the Cable Club area (ask the attendant at the Cable Club counter).  
3. Decide on your activity:  
   - Trade Pokémon  
   - Battle another player  
4. If the connection fails:  
   - Keep both Game Boys linked  
   - Turn both systems off  
   - Turn both systems on  
   - Attempt to connect again  

### Decision Rules
- If you want to trade for Pokémon unavailable in your version of the game, then coordinate with a player who has those exclusive Pokémon.  
- When a Pokémon is traded to you, it gains 1.5× more experience in future battles.  
- If you need to evolve Machoke, Haunter, or Graveler into Machamp, Gengar, or Golem, respectively, then perform a trade (these evolutions only occur through trading).  
- If a Pokémon refuses to obey in battle, then check your Gym Badges—Pokémon above a certain level will only obey if you have the appropriate League Badge.  

### Key Information
- Traded Pokémon gain extra experience (1.5× normal rate).  
- You cannot earn experience or catch Pokémon in a Cable Club battle.  
- Pokémon must be traded one-for-one; you cannot simply give a Pokémon away.  
- Common Pokémon for you might be rare for another player—use this to your advantage when negotiating trades.  
- Some NPCs in the game also offer trades; if you detect an opportunity for a rare or evolved Pokémon, consider trading with them.  

### Trading-Only Evolutions
- Machoke (No. 67) → Machamp (No. 68)  
- Graveler (No. 75) → Golem (No. 76)  
- Haunter (No. 93) → Gengar (No. 94)

## Battle Strategy: Type Advantages

### Objective
Maximize your odds of winning each battle by selecting Pokémon and attacks with favorable type matchups.

### Key Information
- Pokémon Types: Fire, Water, Electric, Grass, Ground, Poison, and more (15 types in total).
- Each Pokémon type has natural strengths and weaknesses.
- Example Matchups:
  - Electric attacks are strong against Water-type Pokémon.
  - Ground attacks are strong against Electric-type Pokémon.
  - Water-type attacks are strong against Fire-type Pokémon.

### Decision Rules
1. When facing an opponent, identify both your Pokémon’s type and the opponent’s type.  
2. If your type naturally beats the opponent’s (e.g., Electric vs. Water), stay in battle to leverage your advantage.  
3. If your type is at a disadvantage (e.g., Electric vs. Ground), switch to a Pokémon with a more favorable matchup.  
4. If you are significantly underleveled (the opponent is 20+ levels higher), consider strategic switching or using status moves regardless of type advantage.  
5. When teaching new moves, prioritize abilities that cover the Pokémon’s weaknesses or enhance its existing advantages.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Check Your Pokémon’s Type  
   - Observe the type icon or text indicating whether it is Fire, Water, Electric, etc.  
2. Check Opponent’s Type  
   - Look for visual cues or text displayed during battle to confirm whether the opponent is Water, Ground, etc.  
3. Refer to Type Effectiveness  
   - Compare your Pokémon’s type to the opponent’s type:  
     - “A” means you have a clear advantage.  
     - “D” means you should be cautious or switch Pokémon.  
     - “X” indicates a major disadvantage and little chance of success.  
     - Blank means a fairly even matchup.  
4. Choose Moves Accordingly  
   - If you see a strong advantage (e.g., Water vs. Fire), use Water-type attacks.  
   - If you see a disadvantage (e.g., Electric vs. Ground), switch to a Pokémon with Ground- or Water-type moves.  
5. Manage Experience Differences  
   - If your Pokémon is underleveled, use status effects (e.g., sleep, paralysis) or consider leveling before re-engaging.  

### Additional Tips
- Don’t rely solely on matching types. Even a Water-type Pokémon can learn moves like Ice Beam or Psychic.  
- Balance your team with diverse types and complementary moves to handle a variety of opponents.  
- Keep an eye on opponent level: a high-level Pokémon may overcome type weaknesses if the gap is large.  

Use this guidance whenever you enter a battle to select the most effective Pokémon and attacks, ensuring consistent victories.

# Pokemon Yellow Guide - Page 13

## General Team Strategy

### Objective
Build and maintain a balanced team that can handle many different Pokémon types throughout the adventure.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Include a mix of physical-attack specialists and special-attack specialists.  
2. For early-game progression, use:  
   • Wartortle (Water)  
   • Pikachu (Electric)  
   • Pidgeotto (Flying)  
   • Diglett (Ground)  
   • Metapod (Bug, evolving into Butterfree)  
   • Rattata (Normal)  
3. As you reach mid- to late-game, transition to a stronger lineup:  
   • Blastoise (Water)  
   • Raichu (Electric)  
   • Machamp (Fighting)
   • Dugtrio (Ground)  
   • Flareon (Fire)  
   • Alakazam (Psychic)  
4. Keep your Pokémon at competitive levels to avoid being overpowered or too weak.  
5. Switch team members as needed if certain types pose a threat you cannot counter effectively.

### Decision Rules
• If you expect a specific opposing Pokémon type, reorder your party so a Pokémon with a type advantage is first.  
• If your active Pokémon is at risk of fainting, substitute immediately to prolong battle and capture opportunities.  
• When searching for new Pokémon to catch, consider using slightly weaker Pokémon to avoid accidentally defeating them before capture.

## Status Effects Strategy

### Objective
Apply and manage status conditions (Poison, Paralysis, Sleep, Burn, Freeze) to gain an advantage in battles.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Use status-inflicting moves (e.g., PoisonPowder, Thunder Wave, Sleep Powder) to immobilize or weaken targets.  
2. Follow up with strong attacks while the opposing Pokémon is affected and less likely to retaliate.  
3. Take advantage of status effects to make catching wild Pokémon easier.

### Decision Rules
• If you want to capture a wild Pokémon more easily, use Sleep or Paralysis moves before throwing a Poké Ball.  
• If the opposing Pokémon frequently uses special moves, apply Paralysis to reduce its chance to strike first.

## Stats and Attack Types

### Objective
Optimize physical and special moves based on your Pokémon’s Attack, Defense, Speed, and Special stats.

### Key Information
• Attack (Physical / “A Type”): Governs moves like Tackle, Bite, or Karate Chop.  
• Defense: Determines how well your Pokémon endures physical damage.  
• Speed: Higher Speed often allows attacking first in each turn.  
• Special (Special / “B Type”): Governs moves like Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, or Psychic and also your Pokémon’s special defense.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Lead with a fast Pokémon (high Speed) to strike quickly and gain an early advantage.  
2. If facing a strong physical attacker (e.g., Primeape), switch to a Pokémon with high Defense.  
3. If an opponent relies on special moves (e.g., Alakazam), use a Pokémon with a high Special stat for better resilience.  
4. Adjust your party order and moveset based on the type of attacks likely to be encountered.

### Decision Rules
• When encountering a Fighting-type Pokémon, prioritize high Defense teammates.  
• If you need quick knockouts, use fast attackers first, then pivot to bulkier teammates to finish the job.

## Type Categories (Reference)

A Type (Physical):  
• Flying  
• Bug  
• Normal  
• Ground  
• Ghost  
• Fighting  
• Rock  

B Type (Special):  
• Fire  
• Water  
• Ice  
• Electric  
• Poison  
• Psychic  
• Dragon  

Use these categories to determine which stat (Attack or Special) your moves rely on and which stat is most effective to boost or defend against.

# Pokemon Yellow Guide - Page 14

## Version Differences
**Objective**: Understand which Trainers, Pokémon, and items appear in each version (Red, Blue, Yellow) so you can plan your journey accordingly.

1. **Trainer Indicators**  
   - When you see a circle around a Trainer on the map:  
     - Blue Circle → This Trainer appears only in Red and Blue.  
     - Orange Ring → This Trainer appears only in Yellow.  
2. **Pokémon Encounters**  
   - Fishing or Surfing → Water-type Pokémon often appear only by fishing or encountering them while Surfing.  
   - Color-Coded Availability →  
     - Black text → Pokémon or items found in all versions.  
     - Red text → Pokémon or items exclusive to Red/Blue.  
     - Yellow text → Pokémon or items exclusive to Yellow.  
   - When a Pokémon’s name is highlighted or circled as exclusive to Yellow, then check whether a special task is needed (e.g., completing a specific side quest) before it appears in the wild.  
3. **Item Indicators**  
   - Black Item Name → Usable in Red, Blue, and Yellow.  
   - Red Item Name → Usable only in Red/Blue.  
   - Yellow Item Name → Usable only in Yellow.  
4. **Rarity Notes**  
   - If a Pokémon is listed as “Rare,” then expect a low encounter rate. Prepare to spend extra time in tall grass or fishing.  
   - If a Pokémon is marked as “Not found” in a version, then do not waste time hunting for it there.

---

## Using the World Map
**Objective**: Navigate the Kanto region efficiently by consulting your World Map (or Town Map) for routes, cities, and special areas.

1. **Step-by-Step Action**  
   1. Open the World Map from your menu.  
   2. Identify your current location and the next city or route you want to visit.  
   3. When you cannot find how to progress, then re-check the Map for alternate paths or hidden routes.  
   4. If you see a Trainer icon, then verify its color indicator (blue for Red/Blue, orange for Yellow).  
2. **Decision Rule**  
   - When new areas become accessible (e.g., you have acquired Surf), then revisit the Map to locate water routes where you can catch rare Water-type Pokémon.  

---

## Tactical Tips for Encounters
**Objective**: Maximize effectiveness in catching and training Pokémon.

1. **Fishing & Surfing**  
   - When you enter a water area, decide whether to use the Fishing Rod or Surf based on which Pokémon are available in that location.  
   - If you need a specific Water-type Pokémon, then check version exclusivity before using your rod or Surfing to save time.  
2. **Preparing Your Team**  
   - Before battling a Gym or encountering a special Trainer, ensure your party covers multiple types so you can adapt to each opponent’s Pokémon.  
   - If facing Team Rocket in Yellow, then expect different Pokémon from their Red/Blue teams and plan accordingly (e.g., bring Psychic-types to counter Poison-type Pokémon).  
3. **Early Item Usage**  
   - When you find Potions in all versions (item name in black), then consider stocking up early to avoid frequent Pokémon Center visits.  
   - If you locate an exclusive Yellow-only item (item name in yellow), then prioritize grabbing it for potential storyline or quest advantages.

---

## Battle Preparation & Strategy
**Objective**: Enter battles with the right Pokémon and items for your version of the game.

1. **Step-by-Step Action**  
   1. Review the opponent Trainer’s icon color to confirm which version’s roster they likely use.  
   2. If the Trainer is Yellow-exclusive, then expect Pokémon not found in Red/Blue.  
   3. Select Pokémon in your party that have type advantages or resistances.  
   4. Stock up on healing items (in black text) to ensure they work in your version.  
2. **Decision Rules**  
   - When encountering a rare Pokémon (rated “Rare” or with a low encounter rate), then prepare additional Poké Balls and status-inducing moves (sleep or paralysis) for higher catch rates.  
   - If you see an item or Pokémon name in red text, then ignore it if you are playing Yellow—it won’t appear in your game.

---

## Key Information Summary
- **Trainer Rings**: Blue = Red/Blue only, Orange = Yellow only.  
- **Items**: Black = All Versions, Red = Red/Blue only, Yellow = Yellow only.  
- **Pokémon Locations**:  
  - Water-type → Found via Fishing or Surfing.  
  - Version Exclusive → Check color-coded names to verify availability.  
- **Rare Pokémon**: Plan extra time for hunting; use status moves to increase catch chances.  
- **Team Differences**: Prepare for altered Team Rocket rosters in Yellow vs. Red/Blue.  
- **World Map**: Always verify your next route and the Trainer indicators to avoid wasted trips.

Use these structured notes to guide your decision-making at each stage of Pokémon Yellow.

## Pallet Town  
### Objective  
Begin your journey, gather initial resources, and secure your first Pokémon.

### Step-by-Step Actions  
1. Check Your PC at Home  
   - When starting the game, go to your PC and withdraw the stored Potion.  
   - This gives you an early healing item for your first battles.

2. Say Goodbye to Mom  
   - Leave your home and speak to Mom if you need to heal your Pokémon at any point.

3. Visit Gary’s House  
   - Gary is absent, but his sister is there.  
   - If you return later, she will give you a useful item (regardless of Gary’s attitude).

4. Go to Professor Oak’s Lab  
   - Attempt to head north to Route 1.  
   - When you enter the tall grass, Professor Oak will stop you and escort you to his lab.

5. Receive Your Starter Pokémon  
   - If playing Pokémon Yellow: You receive a special Pikachu that follows you outside its Poké Ball.  
   - If playing Pokémon Red or Blue: You must choose Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle.

6. Battle Gary  
   - Gary will challenge you to your first Pokémon battle.  
   - When your Pokémon’s HP is low or it faints, return home and talk to Mom to restore health.

### Decision Rules  
- If you want to keep Pikachu happy (Pokémon Yellow), do NOT trade it away. Trading Pikachu allows its evolution by Thunder Stone, but it will no longer follow you.  
- If you lose to Gary, always return home for a free heal before attempting any further exploration.

---

## Key Pokémon & Evolutions  
### Pikachu (Electric)  
- Signature Trait: Follows you in Pokémon Yellow.  
- Combined Voltage: Multiple Pikachu in one place can cause electrical disturbances.  
- Evolution Restriction: Cannot evolve with a Thunder Stone in Pokémon Yellow unless traded away first.

### Thunder Stone (Electric Evolutions)  
- Evolves certain Electric-type Pokémon (e.g., Pikachu into Raichu), but not permitted on Yellow-version Pikachu unless traded out of your game.

### Tentacool (Water/Poison)  
- Found in warm, shallow water.  
- Frequently encountered by fishing or swimming.  
- Watch out for its acidic sting attacks.

### Staryu (Water) → Starmie (Water/Psychic)  
- Evolution via Water Stone.  
- Starmie gains a powerful Psychic typing but trades some mobility for size.  
- Staryu often uses Minimize to evade attacks.

### Water Stone (Water Evolutions)  
- Use to evolve Pokémon like Staryu into Starmie.  
- Higher stats and new typing can provide significant advantages.

---

## Route 21 (Late-Game Access)  
### Objective  
Travel to Cinnabar Island by water route.

### Step-by-Step Actions  
1. Obtain Surf (HM 03)  
   - When you have Surf, return to Pallet Town.  
   - Surf south to access Route 21 directly.

2. Capture or Battle  
   - Pokémon Found by Surf/Fishing:
     - Poliwag (#60, Water)  
     - Tentacool (#72, Water/Poison)  
     - Staryu (#120, Water)  
   - Use type advantages when encountering Water- or Poison-type Pokémon.

### Decision Rules  
- If you lack Surf, you cannot proceed through Route 21.  
- If facing Tentacool, use Electric or Psychic moves for an advantage.  
- If you want a Staryu to evolve into Starmie, keep a Water Stone ready.

---

## Training & Strategy Notes  
- Always check your PC for early items (like Potions).  
- Return to Mom for healing instead of using expensive healing items when near Pallet Town.  
- Select your starter based on preferred battle style (Pikachu in Yellow, or Grass/Fire/Water in Red/Blue).  
- Plan evolution stones early—especially if you want Starmie or Raichu on your team.  
- Water routes (like Route 21) often open after acquiring key HMs (like Surf).

## Pallet Town: Rival’s Choice
**Objective**  
• Understand how your rival’s Eevee evolves based on outcomes of early battles.  
• Begin your journey with Pikachu in Pokémon Yellow.

**Key Information**  
• Your starter is Pikachu.  
• Your rival (Gary) starts with Eevee.  
• Eevee’s evolution path depends on your battle performance:  
  - If you lose at Professor Oak’s Lab, Eevee eventually becomes Vaporeon (Water-type).  
  - If you win at the Lab AND win the battle west of Viridian City, Eevee becomes Jolteon (Electric-type).  
  - If you win at the Lab but lose or skip the battle west of Viridian City, Eevee becomes Flareon (Fire-type).

**Step-by-Step Actions**  
1. Talk to Professor Oak to receive Pikachu.  
2. Challenge your rival when prompted:  
   - When you see Gary in the Lab, speak to him to initiate the first battle.  
3. Apply the above decision rules to track Eevee’s eventual evolution.  

---

## Route 1: Heading to Viridian City
**Objective**  
• Train Pikachu en route to Viridian City.  
• Safely navigate and collect items.

**Key Information**  
• Wild Pokémon:  
  - Pidgey (Normal/Flying-type): Often uses Sand-Attack to lower accuracy.  
  - Rattata (Normal-type): Uses sharp teeth for strong physical attacks.  
• You cannot yet catch new Pokémon (no Poké Balls available).

**Step-by-Step Actions**  
1. Travel north from Pallet Town toward Viridian City.  
2. Engage in wild battles to increase Pikachu’s experience:  
   - When in danger of fainting, use Run to escape.  
   - Return home to Mom or proceed to the Viridian City Pokémon Center to heal if needed.  
3. Speak to any NPC you encounter:  
   - One will give you a free Potion to restore HP.  

**Hedge Hurdle Tip**  
• If you see hedges along the path, jump over them only when moving downward.  
• Avoid trapping yourself in hedges by checking your path before you leap.

---

## Summary of Decision Points
1. **Professor Oak’s Lab Rival Battle**  
   - Lose → Eevee → Vaporeon  
   - Win → Potential Jolteon or Flareon based on next fight

2. **Battle West of Viridian City**  
   - Win again → Eevee → Jolteon  
   - Lose or skip → Eevee → Flareon

3. **Route 1 Training**  
   - When low on HP, either run or heal  
   - When encountering hedges, jump downward carefully  

Use these rules and steps to guide your decisions as you begin your Pokémon Yellow journey.

### Key Information
• Dream Eater (TM42) is a powerful move that restores HP if the target is asleep.  
• Route 2 leads to Viridian Forest and onward to Pewter City.

---

## Poliwag (Pokédex #60)

### Strategy Tip
• Early-game Water-type Pokémon can be useful against Rock-, Ground-, or Fire-type opponents.  
• Poliwag’s Speed and Water moves can provide an advantage in the first few Gyms if leveled properly.
---

# Pokemon Yellow Guide - Page 19

## Route 22 (Optional Rival Battle)

**Objective**: Decide whether to engage Gary in an early battle west of Viridian City.

### Key Information
- Gary’s Pokémon:
  - Lv. 8 Eevee
  - Lv. 9 Spearow
- This battle is optional. It occurs early in the game, and you are not required to travel down Route 22 yet.
- Your own Pokémon should be leveled sufficiently to handle Gary’s team (around Lv. 8–10 recommended).

### Decision Rule
- **If** your Pokémon team is not well-leveled, **then** skip this battle for now. 
- **If** you want to gain experience and are confident in your team’s levels, **then** battle Gary to earn extra cash and experience.

### Step-by-Step Actions

---

## Route 2 Exploration

**Objective**: Capture new Pokémon and progress toward Viridian Forest.

### Key Information
- Common Pokémon:   
  - Pidgey (Normal/Flying)  
  - Rattata (Normal)  
- Rare Pokémon (varies by version): Caterpie (Bug), Weedle (Bug), and possibly Nidoran♀ or Nidoran♂ (Poison).  
- Strategy: Always weaken Pokémon before throwing Poké Balls.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Move north toward Viridian Forest.  
2. Search the tall grass for Pokémon (Pidgey, Rattata, Caterpie, Weedle, Nidoran).  
3. **When** you are trying to catch a Pokémon, **then** reduce its HP to low yellow or red before using a Poké Ball.  
4. Build a balanced team, keeping in mind that Bug-type Pokémon are useful early on against certain foes.

---

## Viridian Forest Entrance

**Objective**: Traverse the forest or use the Cut shortcut.

### Key Information
- Viridian Forest is filled with Bug-type Pokémon (Caterpie, Weedle).  
- Collect experience for your team before the first Gym.  
- The shortcut around the forest requires HM 01 (Cut).

### Decision Rule
- **If** you want to collect Bug-type Pokémon or gain extra experience, **then** go through the forest.  
- **If** you have HM 01 (Cut) and want to avoid random encounters, **then** use it to clear the bush leading to the shortcut.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Determine whether you need extra training from wild Pokémon inside Viridian Forest.  
2. If you have Cut, chop down the bush blocking the shortcut.  
3. Keep an eye on your team’s health and return to a Pokémon Center if needed.

---

## Diglett’s Cave and Route 2 Connection

**Objective**: Access the eastern section of Route 2 and optional trade for Mr. Mime.

### Key Information
- You can only reach this side of Route 2 by exiting Diglett’s Cave (entrance on Route 11).  
- There is a house here where you can trade for Mr. Mime.  
- Yellow Version trade: Mr. Mime in exchange for Clefairy.  
- Red/Blue trade: Mr. Mime in exchange for Abra.

### Decision Rule
- **If** you want Mr. Mime, **then** prepare the correct Pokémon (Clefairy in Yellow; Abra in Red/Blue).  
- **If** you are not interested in Mr. Mime or do not have the trade Pokémon, **then** proceed without trading.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Enter Diglett’s Cave from Route 11 to emerge on Route 2 (eastern side).  
2. Use Cut to clear the bush blocking the path to the house.  
3. Speak to the resident inside the house to initiate the trade (if you have the required Pokémon).  
4. Consider adding Mr. Mime to your team for its Psychic-type advantages, noting it does not evolve.

---

## Collecting HM 05 (Flash)

**Objective**: Obtain Flash to light up dark areas later in the adventure.

### Key Information
- The resident in the Route 2 house will give you Flash (HM 05) if you have at least 10 Pokémon registered in your Pokédex.
- Flash is essential for navigating certain caves (e.g., Rock Tunnel).

### Decision Rule
- **If** you have fewer than 10 Pokémon caught, **then** capture more along Route 2 and Viridian Forest first.  
- **If** you meet the requirement, **then** speak to the resident and receive HM 05.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Check your Pokédex count (must be 10 or higher to receive Flash).  
2. If necessary, catch more Pokémon on Routes 2, 22, and within Viridian Forest.  
3. Return to the house, speak to the resident, and collect the HM 05 Flash.  
4. Teach Flash to a compatible Pokémon for future cave exploration.

---

## Summary of Key Strategic Points

1. **Rival Battle (Route 22)**: Optional early challenge; ensure your levels are adequate.  
2. **Route 2**: Good area for catching common and rare Pokémon before the first Gym.  
3. **Viridian Forest**: Useful for Bug-type captures and training; shortcut available with Cut.  
4. **Diglett’s Cave to Route 2 (East)**: Trading opportunity for Mr. Mime (Psychic-type).  
5. **HM 05 (Flash)**: Must have at least 10 Pokémon in your Pokédex to obtain it.  

Use these steps and decisions to guide your early-game progress in Pokémon Yellow.

```markdown
## Location: Route 2

**Objective:**
- Travel between Viridian City and Pewter City.
- Explore the nature preserve in the middle of Route 2 to capture new Pokémon and collect items.

**Step-by-Step Actions:**
1. From Viridian City, enter Route 2 and head north toward Pewter City.  
2. Explore the central nature preserve; watch for wild Pokémon in the tall grass.  
3. Pick up hidden items along the route (notably a Potion near the boy standing in the grass).  
4. Collect basic supplies (Poké Ball, additional Potion, and Antidote) if you haven’t already.

**Decision Rules:**
- If facing trainer battles, prepare your Pokémon first (heal and restock items). You cannot run from trainer battles on Route 2.
- If you want to prevent a Pokémon from evolving, press B during the evolution sequence.

**Key Information:**
- Pokémon are plentiful here, so it’s a good spot to build a balanced team early on.
- Trainer-owned Pokémon can be stronger than wild Pokémon. Heal frequently and save your game beforehand.

---

## Location: Viridian Forest

**Objective:**
- Capture valuable Pokémon, especially Pikachu (in Red/Blue versions), and train your team before reaching Pewter City.

**Step-by-Step Actions:**
1. Enter Viridian Forest from the north end of Route 2.  
2. Search thoroughly for Pikachu if you are playing Pokémon Red or Blue (as multiple Pikachu can appear here).  
   - In Pokémon Yellow, you start with a single Pikachu; no additional wild Pikachu appear.  
3. Catch Caterpie (Dex #10) and Pidgey (Dex #16) to train them toward their evolutions.
4. Gather items on the forest floor (look for Potions and other hidden objects).
5. Engage Bug-type trainers along the paths to gain experience for your team.

**Decision Rules:**
- If you want to train two Pikachu (Red/Blue), evolve one with a Thunder Stone to Raichu and leave the other unevolved if you want to keep a Pikachu permanently.
- If encountering aggressive Bug-type trainers, use Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgey or Pidgeotto to gain a type advantage.

**Key Information:**
- Common Bug-types: Caterpie and Metapod.  
- Flying-types are highly effective against Bug-type Pokémon.  
- Pidgeotto (Dex #17) can be found in the wild or obtained by evolving Pidgey at level 18.

---

## Duels with Trainers

**Objective:**
- Defeat all trainer challenges to progress through the forest and Route 2 without missing valuable experience.

**Step-by-Step Actions:**
1. Speak to each trainer who blocks the path; you cannot run from these battles.  
2. Monitor your team’s HP and status. Use Potions or return to the nearest Pokémon Center if needed.  
3. Use type advantages:
   - Flying-type moves against Bug-types.  
   - Electric or Rock-type moves (once available) against Flying-types like Pidgey or Spearow.

**Decision Rules:**
- If your active Pokémon’s HP gets too low, switch to a healthier ally or use healing items.
- If your team is under-leveled, consider battling wild Pokémon to gain experience before challenging trainers.

**Key Information:**
- Trainer-owned Pokémon can be higher level than surrounding wild Pokémon.  
- Planning your team composition ahead helps ensure victory.

---

## Pokémon Evolutions & Tips

### Caterpie → Metapod → Butterfree
- Caterpie evolves into Metapod at level 7.  
- Metapod evolves into Butterfree at level 10.  
- Press B to cancel evolution if you want to keep a Pokémon unevolved.

### Pidgey → Pidgeotto → Pidgeot
- Pidgey evolves into Pidgeotto at level 18.  
- Pidgeotto evolves into Pidgeot (Dex #18) at level 36.  
- Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeot are natural enemies of Bug-types.

### Pikachu → Raichu
- In Pokémon Yellow, you only have one Pikachu (it won’t appear in Viridian Forest).  
- In Pokémon Red/Blue, you can catch Pikachu in Viridian Forest to get multiple copies.  
- Evolve Pikachu with a Thunder Stone to get Raichu.

**Key Information:**
- Pressing B during the evolution animation stops that evolution.  
- Consider evolving one Pikachu (Red/Blue) and saving another as Pikachu for flexibility.

---

## Overall Strategy

- Use Route 2 and Viridian Forest to build up your lower-level Pokémon.  
- Collect items diligently to avoid running out of Potions and Poké Balls.  
- Exploit type matchups (especially Flying vs. Bug) to clear early-game trainer battles.  
- Plan when to evolve Pokémon based on movesets and personal preference.  
- Save often, especially before trainer battles or tough wild Pokémon encounters.
```

# Pokemon Yellow Guide - Page 21

## Pewter City
### Primary Objective
• Prepare your team for the first Gym challenge by healing at the Pokémon Center and stocking up on items.  
• Defeat Brock in the Pewter City Gym to access Route 3.  

### Available Facilities
1. **Pokémon Center**  
   - Heal your team before any major battles.  
   - Use this facility to recover HP and PP after training or exploring.  

2. **Pokémon Mart**  
   - Purchase essential items:  
     - Poké Ball (200)

• Currently rumors exist about scientists cloning new Pokémon from these fossils.  

### Secret Lab (Behind the Museum)
• Entrance is blocked by a bush.  
• When you have learned the “Cut” ability later in the game, return here to explore further.  

### Step-by-Step Actions in Pewter City
1. Visit the Pokémon Center to fully heal your party.  
2. Go to the Pokémon Mart to buy Poké Balls, Potions, and any status-healing items you need.  
3. Explore the Museum of Science if desired, but note it has no direct gameplay advantage yet.  
4. Attempt to access the secret lab only after you acquire HM01 (Cut).  
5. Proceed to the Gym when you are ready to challenge Brock.  

### Decision Rules
- If your Pokémon are low on health or status-afflicted, then return to the Pokémon Center immediately.  
- If you anticipate a tough battle against Brock, then stock up on enough Potions and status cures at the Mart.  
- If you have not defeated Brock, then you cannot pass east to Route 3.  

---

## Pewter City Gym
### Objective
• Defeat the Junior Trainer (optional but good for experience).  
• Challenge Brock to earn the Boulder Badge.  

### Brock’s Battle
• Brock specializes in Rock/Ground-type Pokémon.  
• In Pokémon Yellow, he typically uses:  
  - Geodude (Lv. 10)  
  - Onix (Lv. 12)  

### Effective Strategies
• Use Water- or Grass-type attacks for strong damage.  
• Fighting- and Ground-type moves also do well.  
• Avoid Electric-, Poison-, or Rock-type moves against Brock’s team; they will do minimal damage.  

### Step-by-Step Actions for the Gym Battle
1. Defeat or bypass the Junior Trainer if you want extra experience.  
2. Initiate the battle with Brock, focusing on Water- or Grass-type attacks.  
3. Monitor your Pokémon’s HP and use Potions as needed.  
4. Knock out Geodude first, then handle Onix with the same strategy.  

### Key Information
• Upon victory over Brock, you receive:  
  - TM34 (Bide)  
  - The Boulder Badge (increases your Pokémon’s power slightly and allows the use of “Flash” once you obtain HM05).  
• When you have the Boulder Badge, the path to Route 3 opens, letting you continue your journey.
---

# Pokemon Yellow Guide - Page 22

## After Receiving the Boulder Badge

### Objective
• Advance through Route 3 to face multiple Trainers.  
• Capture new Pokémon to strengthen your team.  
• Prepare for upcoming challenges by stocking up on crucial items.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Leave Pewter City once you have the Boulder Badge in hand.  
2. Purchase extra Poké Balls at the Poké Mart before entering Route 3.  
3. Battle each of the eight Trainers along Route 3 to gain experience.  
4. Use type advantages when facing your opponents to secure faster victories.  
5. Capture any desired wild Pokémon on Route 3 to expand your roster.

### Decision Rules
• If your team is low on health during battles, then use Potions or return to the Pokémon Center.  
• If you spot a Pokémon you want (e.g., Mankey for Fighting-type coverage), then throw a Poké Ball after weakening it.

### Key Information
• Eight Trainers on Route 3 will seek to battle you.  
• Winning these battles raises your Pokémon’s levels and overall strength.  
• Wild Pokémon on Route 3 include:  
  - #16 Pidgey (Normal/Flying)  
  - #19 Rattata (Normal)  
  - #21 Spearow (Normal/Flying)  
  - #27 Sandshrew (Ground; only in Yellow/Blue)  
  - #39 Jigglypuff (Normal)  
  - #56 Mankey (Fighting)  

---

## Pokémon Center (Route 3 Vicinity)

### Objective
• Heal your team.  
• Decide whether to purchase a Magikarp from the traveling salesman.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Upon reaching the Pokémon Center near Route 3, talk to the traveling salesman.  
2. Evaluate your finances: consider that Magikarp can be caught for free later, but buying one now offers an early Water-type option.  
3. Heal your Pokémon to full strength before moving on to Mt. Moon.

### Decision Rules
• If you need a powerful Water-type attacker sooner in the game, then buy the Magikarp.  
• If you prefer to save money for other items, then wait to catch Magikarp for free later.

### Key Information
• Magikarp evolves into Gyarados, a formidable Water/Flying-type.  
• You can only purchase Magikarp here in this unique opportunity.  

---

## Route 3 Pokémon Highlights

### Spearow vs. Pidgey
• Spearow (#21, Normal/Flying) is more aggressive and can outmatch Pidgey (#16, Normal/Flying) in direct combat.  

### Sandshrew
• Ground-type (#27) found in Yellow and Blue versions.  
• Can dig quickly and avoid special attacks.  
• Weak to Water- and Grass-type moves.  

### Mankey
• Fighting-type (#56).  
• Notable for speed and agility; it can dodge special attacks easily.  
• Effective against Normal-type opponents.  

---

## Mt. Moon

### Objective
• Explore the caves to find new Pokémon and items.  
• Thwart Team Rocket’s plan to steal Pokémon fossils.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Enter Mt. Moon with a supply of Potions and Poké Balls.  
2. Engage (or avoid) wild Pokémon as you navigate the tunnels.  
3. Battle Team Rocket grunts to prevent them from collecting fossils.  
4. Collect useful items and the chosen fossil at the end of Mt. Moon.

### Decision Rules
• If you encounter Geodude, then use Water- or Grass-type moves for a quick victory.  
• If your Electric-type Pokémon is active, then switch it out, as Electric moves do not affect Ground/Rock-types.  
• If low on health, then retreat to the Pokémon Center or use healing items.

### Key Information
• Common Wild Pokémon: Zubat, Geodude, and Paras (among others).  
• Team Rocket is present and will challenge you to multiple battles.  
• Geodude (#74, Rock/Ground):  
  - Often mistaken for a rock.  
  - Weak to Water and Grass.  
  - Immune to Electric-type attacks; resistant to Rock-type moves.

# Pokemon Yellow Guide - Page 23

## Mt. Moon – Overview
**Objective**: Traverse Mt. Moon’s floors to collect items, train your team, and potentially catch rare Pokémon like Clefairy.  
**Key Information**:  
- Mt. Moon has three levels (First Floor, First Basement, Second Basement).  
- Rare Pokémon: Clefairy (#35).  
- Useful items: Potions, Rare Candy, Escape Rope, Moon Stone, Ether.  

---

## Mt. Moon – First Floor
**Objective**: Explore and gather initial items; begin searching for Clefairy.  
1. Look for these Pokémon:  
   - Sandshrew (#27, Ground)  
   - Clefairy (#35, Normal) – rare encounter  
   - Zubat (#41, Poison/Flying)  
   - Paras (#46, Bug/Grass)  
   - Geodude (#74, Rock/Ground)  
2. Collect available items along this floor:  
   - Potion  
   - Rare Candy  
   - Escape Rope  
   - Moon Stone  
3. When you see a Clefairy, consider catching it because Clefairy is only found here and one other location outside Mt. Moon.  

**Decision Rule**:  
- When you encounter Clefairy and want future Normal-type coverage, use Poké Balls to capture it immediately, as Clefairy is uncommon and evolves into Clefable (which cannot learn new moves naturally).  

---

## Mt. Moon – First Basement
**Objective**: Deepen your search for Clefairy or train other Pokémon; locate hidden items.  
1. Expected Pokémon encounters:  
   - Clefairy (#35, Normal) – still few  
   - Zubat (#41, Poison/Flying) – many  
   - Paras (#46, Bug/Grass) – few  
   - Geodude (#74, Rock/Ground) – many  
2. If you need more chances for Clefairy, linger here; the encounter rate may be slightly better than the upper floor for certain Pokémon.  

**Decision Rule**:  
- When your Pokémon are low on HP or you run out of items, use an Escape Rope or return to the Pokémon Center before proceeding, to ensure your team stays healthy.  

---

## Mt. Moon – Second Basement
**Objective**: Acquire Fossils and complete your traversal of Mt. Moon.  
1. Expected Pokémon encounters:  
   - Clefairy (#35, Normal) – still possible  
   - Zubat (#41, Poison/Flying)  
   - Paras (#46, Bug/Grass)  
   - Geodude (#74, Rock/Ground) – many  
2. Walk to the left side of the prominent rock formation and press “A” to discover an Ether (restores 10 PP to one move).  
3. Prepare for Fossil collection and potential battles with Trainers who guard them.  

**Decision Rule**:  
- When planning to evolve Clefairy into Clefable, remember Clefable cannot learn additional moves by leveling up, so teach all desired moves to Clefairy first.  

---

## Route 3
**Objective**: Train and catch new Pokémon before entering Mt. Moon.  
1. Pokémon availability here is generally lower variety compared to Mt. Moon.  
2. Use this area to raise weaker team members before facing Mt. Moon challenges.  

**Decision Rule**:  
- If your team is under-leveled, then stay on Route 3 to battle wild Pokémon until you feel comfortable tackling Trainers inside Mt. Moon.  

---

## Route 4
**Objective**: Exit Mt. Moon and move toward Cerulean City.  
1. Mostly a transition route with fewer Pokémon encounters.  
2. Use the Pokémon Center if needed before heading east.  

**Decision Rule**:  
- When you exit Mt. Moon and find yourself on Route 4, then rest at the nearby Pokémon Center if resources are low.  

---

## Key Strategy Notes
1. Clefairy Rarity:  
   - If you spot Clefairy, catch it early; it’s rare outside Mt. Moon.  
   - Once evolved into Clefable, rely on TMs/HMs for new moves.  
2. Zubat’s Leech Life:  
   - When Zubat uses Leech Life, your Pokémon’s HP will be drained; consider switching to a resistant type or healing promptly.  
3. Paras’s Stun Spore:  
   - If Paras uses Stun Spore, you risk being paralyzed. Carry Paralyze Heals.  
4. Geodude’s Rock/Ground Type:  
   - When facing Geodude, use Water, Grass, or Fighting moves for effectiveness.  
5. Item Management:  
   - Keep a Potion or two for mid-dungeon heals.  
   - Moon Stone evolves certain Pokémon (like Clefairy into Clefable).  
   - Ether helps when you run low on PP during long dungeon exploration.  

Use this guidance to navigate Mt. Moon effectively, manage your team’s health, capture rare Pokémon, and advance closer to Cerulean City.

## Mt. Moon Exit (Team Rocket Battle)

**Objective**  
Defeat the Team Rocket duo near the exit to Mt. Moon and claim a Pokémon Fossil.

**Key Information**  
- In Pokémon Yellow, Jessie and James demand you hand over the Fossil before you can exit.  
- They use the following party:  
  - Ekans (Level 14)  
  - Meowth (Level 14)  
  - Koffing (Level 14)  
- Psychic-type moves (e.g., Butterfree’s Confusion) work well against their Poison-type Pokémon.  

**Step-by-Step Actions**  
1. When preparing your party, include a Pokémon with a Psychic-type attack to handle Ekans and Koffing quickly.  
2. Use focused attacks on Meowth if you need to take it out first (it can be feisty and fast).  
3. Heal between each Pokémon if necessary—bring Potions to sustain your team.  
4. Once you defeat Jessie and James, choose one of the two Fossils. If you cannot decide, pick either without worry—both have value later.  

**Decision Rule**  
- If you want a Pokémon with strong defensive stats later (Kabuto → Kabutops), pick the Dome Fossil.  
- If you prefer a Pokémon with a balanced mix of defense and special attack (Omanyte → Omastar), pick the Helix Fossil.

## Cerulean City

**Objective:** Defeat the Cerulean City Gym Leader (Misty), overcome your rival Gary on the bridge to the north, and prepare for future challenges.  

**Key Note:** A person stands beyond the fence on the northwest side of town. This area is inaccessible until later in the game, so do not worry about it until you have progressed much further.

---

## Gym Leader: Misty

**Situation:** Misty specializes in Water-type Pokémon. She always uses:  
- Staryu (Level 18, Water-type)  
- Starmie (Level 21, Water/Psychic-type)

**Objective:** Win the battle to earn the Cascade Badge and TM11 (BubbleBeam).  

### Step-by-Step Actions  
1. Train a Pokémon that has a type advantage over Water (Electric or Grass).  
2. Stock up on Potions or healing items before challenging Misty.  
3. Lead with an Electric-type (such as Pikachu) or a Grass-type (such as Bulbasaur) to exploit Staryu and Starmie’s Water-type weakness.  
4. Focus first on Staryu—use strong single-hit moves to conserve HP for Starmie.  
5. Use type-advantage moves against Starmie; beware of its speed and high Special stat.  

### Decision Rules  
- **If you chose Bulbasaur early (or received it in Cerulean City):** Rely on Vine Whip or similar Grass-type moves to handle Misty’s Water-types.  
- **If you have Pikachu:** ThunderShock or Thunder Wave can make the fight easier.  
- **If you started with Charmander or Squirtle:** You are at a disadvantage. Consider switching to a captured Grass- or Electric-type Pokémon before attempting the Gym.  

### Reward  
- **Cascade Badge**: Lets you command traded Pokémon up to Level 30 and enables the use of HM01 (Cut) outside of battle (once HM01 is obtained).  
- **TM11 (BubbleBeam)**: A powerful Water-type move you can teach to compatible Pokémon.  

---

## Rival Battle: Gary (Second Encounter)

**Situation:** After defeating Misty, head north from Cerulean City. Your rival Gary waits on the bridge with four Pokémon in Pokémon Yellow. His team typically includes:  
- Spearow (Level 18, Normal/Flying-type)  
- Sandshrew (Level 15, Ground-type)  
- Rattata (appears in some versions; Normal-type)  
- Eevee (Level 17, Normal-type)

**Objective:** Defeat Gary to proceed across the bridge and face the Nugget challenge from Team Rocket.

### Step-by-Step Actions  
1. Lead with an Electric-type (like Pikachu) to handle Spearow.  
2. Switch to a Grass-type (like Bulbasaur) if Sandshrew appears. (Electric moves have no effect on Sandshrew.)  
3. Beware of Rattata’s quick attacks if it is in Gary’s lineup; keep a higher-level Pokémon to ensure one-hit or two-hit knockouts.  
4. Target Eevee with strong Fighting-type or other high-damage moves to finish it quickly.  

### Decision Rules  
- **If you have Bulbasaur:** Use it against Sandshrew. Grass moves deal super-effective damage.  
- **If you rely on Pikachu:** Avoid battles with Sandshrew or switch to a Grass-type.  
- **If your Pokémon are under Level 15:** Consider training in the nearby routes before challenging Gary and the Nugget Bridge.  

### Reward  
- **Progress north of Cerulean City**: Defeating Gary opens the path.  
- **Team Rocket’s Nugget Challenge**: Battle six consecutive trainers to earn a valuable Nugget before meeting Bill, who can help expand your Pokédex.

---

## Notable Pokémon and Strategies

### Bulbasaur (Grass/Poison)  
- **Strengths:** Effective against Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types.  
- **Weaknesses:** Vulnerable to Fire-, Flying-, Psychic-, and Ice-type moves.  
- **Evolution:** Evolves into Ivysaur at Level 16, further boosting stats and learning more potent Grass-type moves.  
- **Tip:** Combo typings mean double strengths but also double weaknesses—plan ahead when facing opponents that can exploit Poison or Grass weaknesses.

### Bellsprout (Grass/Poison)  
- **Common Strategy:** Often opens with Growth, raising its Special Attack.  
- **Recommendation:** Strike fast with your strongest move before Bellsprout can deliver boosted attacks.  

### Venonat (Bug/Poison)  
- **Habitat:** Frequently found around trees and attracted to bright lights at night.  
- **Battle Advice:** Use Psychic-, Fire-, or Flying-type moves to exploit its Bug/Poison weaknesses.

---

## Summary of Actionable Guidance

1. **Gym Prep:** Level an Electric- or Grass-type Pokémon to counter Misty’s Water team.  
2. **Misty Battle:** Focus short, decisive hits on Staryu and Starmie; avoid letting Starmie set up multiple attacks.  
3. **Gary Battle:** Use Pikachu or another Electric-type for Spearow; switch to a Grass-type for Sandshrew.  
4. **Nugget Bridge:** Defeat six Team Rocket trainers for a valuable Nugget and continue to Bill’s house.  
5. **Combination Pokémon Tips:** Remember that Bulbasaur and other Grass/Poison types possess both advantages and extra vulnerabilities—choose battle strategy accordingly.  
6. **Move Forward:** After earning the Cascade Badge and TM11, use newly strengthened Pokémon to continue your journey toward Vermilion City and beyond.

## Charmander, Charmeleon, and Charizard

**Key Information**  
- Charmander (Fire-type) starts with a flaming tail and can be challenging to train.  
- Charmeleon (Fire-type) evolves from Charmander at Level 16.  
- Charizard (Fire/Flying-type) evolves from Charmeleon at Level 36.  
- Fire-type Pokémon have a strong advantage over Ice-type but are weak against Water-type.  
- In Pokémon Yellow, you can receive a Charmander from a trainer on Route 24 who admits he hasn’t trained it well.

**Strategy**  
1. If you start with Charmander, prepare for an early challenge since Water-type foes are common.  
2. Train Charmander against local Grass- and Bug-type Pokémon to gain rapid experience.  
3. Once Charmander reaches Level 16, it evolves into Charmeleon and gains higher stats.  
4. Continue training until Level 36 to evolve Charmeleon into Charizard, adding Flying-type coverage.

2. Challenge each of the five trainers on the bridge in sequence.  
3. Use Fire-types (e.g., Charmeleon) effectively against Grass- and Bug-type opponents.  
4. Switch to Water- or Electric-type Pokémon if you face Water-type foes.  
5. Upon victory, you’ll receive a Nugget. Team Rocket will attempt to recruit you—refuse their offer.

**Decision Rule**  
- If your Fire-type is low on health or encounters strong Water-types, switch to a Pokémon with an advantageous matchup (e.g., Electric- or Grass-type).

**Key Information**  
- A trainer on Route 24 in Pokémon Yellow will give you a free Charmander.

## Cerulean City to Route 5

**Objective:**  
• Reach Route 5 after visiting Bill and return to Cerulean City.  
• Navigate toward Saffron City, but note the route is currently blocked by a thirsty guard.

**Step-by-Step Actions:**  
1. Start in Cerulean City after completing the visit with Bill.  
2. Go to the house in the northeast corner of Cerulean City.  
3. Exit through the backyard, leading directly to Route 5.

**Decision Rules:**  
• When the guard on Route 5 mentions he’s thirsty, then realize Saffron City is temporarily inaccessible.  
• When Saffron City is blocked, then use the Underground Path to bypass it and continue to Route 6.

**Key Information:**  
• You will need a beverage later to convince the guard to let you enter Saffron City.  
• The Underground Path is the primary detour to progress south.

---

## Pokémon Daycare (Route 5)

**Objective:**  
• Use passive training by leaving one Pokémon to level up at the Daycare.

**Step-by-Step Actions:**  
1. Enter the Pokémon Daycare located on Route 5 before the Underground Path.  
2. Choose one Pokémon to leave with the Daycare.  
3. Continue your adventure. Each step traveled grants 1 experience point to the deposited Pokémon.  
4. Return much later to retrieve your newly leveled-up Pokémon.

**Decision Rules:**  
• When you want to train a weak Pokémon (like Magikarp or Abra) without using it in battle, then deposit it at the Daycare.  
• When you plan to be away for a long journey, then consider the Daycare to passively level up a Pokémon.  
• If your Pokémon passes its usual evolution level while in Daycare, then it will wait for your input to evolve when picked up.

**Key Information:**  
• Cost: 100 Pokédollars for every level gained.  
• The Daycare will automatically teach new abilities but does not allow you to choose which moves to keep.

---

## Underground Path to Route 6

**Objective:**  
• Travel from Route 5 to Route 6 via the Underground Path to progress south.

**Step-by-Step Actions:**  
1. From Route 5, look for the entrance to the Underground Path.  
2. Speak to the NPC near the entrance who might offer a Pokémon trade.  
3. Traverse the path until you emerge on Route 6.

**Decision Rules:**  
• When you cannot pass through Saffron City, then use the Underground Path to bypass the city entirely.  
• If you encounter a trader who wants a Pokémon you do not have, then remember he will wait indefinitely, so you can return later.

**Key Information:**  
• The Underground Path offers a safe, encounter-free shortcut.  
• Another collector here may request a trade for a specific Pokémon (e.g., Machoke). You can complete this anytime once you have the correct Pokémon.

---

## Wild Pokémon on Route 5

- Meowth (Level ~52)  
- Mankey (Level ~56)  
- Abra (Level ~63)  
- Oddish (Level ~43)  
- Bellsprout (Level ~79)

• If you need a Grass-type, then catch Oddish or Bellsprout accordingly (depending on your game version).

---

### Overall Strategy Tips

1. Use Cerulean City as a hub to rest and restock items before heading to Route 5.  
2. Plan Daycare usage carefully if you want to evolve or strengthen a specific Pokémon without active battling.  
3. Expect to return with a beverage to quell the guard’s thirst and open direct access to Saffron City later.  
4. If you encounter a trade request underground, you can fulfill it any time—take note and come back once you have the required Pokémon.

## Pokémon Strategies

### Abra
- **Type**: Psychic  
- **Key Info**:  
  - Has no direct attacking moves and will use Teleport to flee.  
  - Difficult to capture without disabling moves.  
- **Strategic Advice**:  
  1. When encountering Abra, immediately use moves that cause Paralysis or Sleep.  
  2. Prevent Abra from using Teleport by acting in the first turn (e.g., fast Pokémon or Quick Claw if available).  
  3. Once its Teleport is blocked, weaken Abra carefully and use Poké Balls to secure capture.

### Jigglypuff
- **Type**: Normal  
- **Key Info**:  
  - Sing can put your Pokémon to sleep, making them vulnerable.  
  - Pound deals decent damage once you’re asleep.  
- **Strategic Advice**:  
  1. When Jigglypuff uses Sing, be prepared to switch out or use an item to cure Sleep.  
  2. If you need a Normal-type that can also learn various TM moves, Jigglypuff is a flexible choice.  

### Wigglytuff
- **Type**: Normal  
- **Key Info**:  
  - Evolves from Jigglypuff with a Moon Stone.  
  - Inflates itself to intimidate opponents.  
  - Retains Normal-type versatility for learned moves.  
- **Strategic Advice**:  
  1. When you need a sturdy Normal-type with a wide TM pool, consider using a Moon Stone on Jigglypuff.  
  2. Wigglytuff’s high HP can help it withstand hits in battle.

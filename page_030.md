- Obtain the Old Rod from the Fishing Guru.  
- Board the S.S. Anne for critical items and training.  
- Defeat Lt. Surge at the Vermilion City Gym.  

**Key Information:**

1. From Route 6, proceed south into Vermilion City.  
2. Enter the Pokémon Fan Club and speak with the President to receive the Bike Voucher.  
3. Visit the Fishing Guru (in a house near the water) to get the Old Rod. Use it to fish for basic Water-type Pokémon.  
4. Heal at the local Pokémon Center and purchase any needed items at the Pokémon Mart:
   - Poké Ball  
   - Super Potion  
   - Ice Heal  
   - Awakening

**Decision Rules:**
- When you want a Water-type early on, use the Old Rod to fish. You can fight or catch any Pokémon you hook.  
- When playing Pokémon Red/Blue, you may trade a Spearow for Farfetch’d in a cabin near the docks. In Pokémon Yellow, this trade is not available.  
- When you defeat Lt. Surge in Pokémon Yellow, speak to the officer in the center of town to receive Squirtle.

## Vermilion Gym (Lt. Surge)

**Objectives:**

**Decision Rules:**

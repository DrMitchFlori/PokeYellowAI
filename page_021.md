## Pewter City
### Primary Objective
• Prepare your team for the first Gym challenge by healing at the Pokémon Center and stocking up on items.  
• Defeat Brock in the Pewter City Gym to access Route 3.  

### Available Facilities
1. **Pokémon Center**  
   - Heal your team before any major battles.  
   - Use this facility to recover HP and PP after training or exploring.  

2. **Pokémon Mart**  
   - Purchase essential items:  
     - Poké Ball (200)  
     - Potion (300)  
     - Escape Rope (550)  
     - Antidote (100)  
     - Burn Heal (250)  
     - Awakening (200)  
     - Paralyze Heal (200)  
   - Restock on items before entering the Gym or heading to new routes.  

### Museum of Science
• Contains exhibits of Pokémon fossils.  
• Currently rumors exist about scientists cloning new Pokémon from these fossils.  

### Secret Lab (Behind the Museum)
• Entrance is blocked by a bush.  
• When you have learned the “Cut” ability later in the game, return here to explore further.  

### Step-by-Step Actions in Pewter City
1. Visit the Pokémon Center to fully heal your party.  
2. Go to the Pokémon Mart to buy Poké Balls, Potions, and any status-healing items you need.  
3. Explore the Museum of Science if desired, but note it has no direct gameplay advantage yet.  
4. Attempt to access the secret lab only after you acquire HM01 (Cut).  
5. Proceed to the Gym when you are ready to challenge Brock.  

### Decision Rules
- If your Pokémon are low on health or status-afflicted, then return to the Pokémon Center immediately.  
- If you anticipate a tough battle against Brock, then stock up on enough Potions and status cures at the Mart.  
- If you have not defeated Brock, then you cannot pass east to Route 3.

## Pewter City Gym
### Objective
• Defeat the Junior Trainer (optional but good for experience).  
• Challenge Brock to earn the Boulder Badge.  

### Brock’s Battle
• Brock specializes in Rock/Ground-type Pokémon.  
• In Pokémon Yellow, he typically uses:  
  - Geodude (Lv. 10)  
  - Onix (Lv. 12)  

### Effective Strategies
• Use Water- or Grass-type attacks for strong damage.  
• Fighting- and Ground-type moves also do well.  
• Avoid Electric-, Poison-, or Rock-type moves against Brock’s team; they will do minimal damage.  

### Step-by-Step Actions for the Gym Battle
1. Defeat or bypass the Junior Trainer if you want extra experience.  
2. Initiate the battle with Brock, focusing on Water- or Grass-type attacks.  
3. Monitor your Pokémon’s HP and use Potions as needed.  
4. Knock out Geodude first, then handle Onix with the same strategy.  

### Key Information
• Upon victory over Brock, you receive:  
  - TM34 (Bide)  
  - The Boulder Badge (increases your Pokémon’s power slightly and allows the use of “Flash” once you obtain HM05).  
• When you have the Boulder Badge, the path to Route 3 opens, letting you continue your journey.

## The World of Pokémon
**Objective:** Begin your journey to become the world’s greatest Pokémon Trainer.

**Key Information:**
- Pokémon are creatures you can capture and train for battles.
- You must collect as many varieties as possible to help Professor Oak complete the Pokémon encyclopedia.
- Team Rocket is an evil organization that seeks to control all Pokémon.

**Step-by-Step Actions:**
1. Start a new game and enter your character’s name (up to seven letters).  
2. Assign a name to your rival (often “Gary,” but you can choose any name).  
3. Listen to Professor Oak’s introductory guidance on caring for Pokémon.

**Decision Rules:**
- If you want the classic experience, choose “Ash” as your own name and “Gary” as your rival’s.
- Otherwise, pick any names that distinguish your character and rival clearly.

## Starting Out in Pallet Town
**Objective:** Acquire your first Pokémon and begin your training.

**Step-by-Step Actions:**
1. Speak to Professor Oak to receive your starter Pokémon.  
2. In Pokémon Yellow, you automatically get Pikachu instead of the usual Red/Blue starters.  
3. Attempt to place Pikachu in a Poké Ball—note that it refuses and will follow you on-screen.

**Decision Rules:**
- If you are playing Red or Blue, choose from Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle.  
- If you are playing Yellow, your first Pokémon is always Pikachu, with no option to select another starter.

**Key Information:**
- Pikachu is an Electric-type Pokémon.  
- It displays its mood through facial expressions when you turn to face it. Keeping Pikachu happy may offer in-game benefits later.

**Key Information:**
- Your rival (default name: Gary) also wants to become the world’s greatest Pokémon Trainer.
- He appears frequently to battle you throughout the game.

**Step-by-Step Actions:**
1. Choose a rival name you find motivating; you’ll see it often.  
2. Prepare to battle his team regularly at various stages.  

**Decision Rules:**
- When your rival challenges you, check your party’s HP and level.  
- If your Pokémon are too weak, train in nearby grass areas before accepting the battle.

## Version Differences (Red, Blue, Yellow)
**Objective:** Recognize gameplay variations to plan your collection strategy.

**Key Information:**
- Certain Pokémon appear in different locations or have different encounter rates based on the game version.
- Some Pokémon cannot be caught in a given version and must be traded.

**Examples (Route 6):**
- Red Version: You might encounter Pokémon A (commonly found).  
- Blue Version: You might encounter Pokémon B (commonly found).  
- Yellow Version: You might encounter Bellsprout in the same area.

**Decision Rules:**
- If you aim to complete the Pokédex, consider trading with another version to obtain missing Pokémon.  
- When searching for a specific species, confirm which version it appears in before hunting.

## Traveling with Pikachu (Pokémon Yellow Only)
**Objective:** Maintain high Pikachu friendship to unlock special features.

**Step-by-Step Actions:**
1. Turn to face Pikachu on-screen to check its mood (happy, neutral, or upset).  
2. Keep Pikachu satisfied by using items, winning battles, and avoiding fainting.  
3. Pay attention to changes in its facial expression: a happy Pikachu may grant unique in-game benefits.

**Decision Rules:**
- If Pikachu becomes unhappy (frowning or turning away), use potions or walk around with it to improve friendship.  
- When Pikachu seems happy, consider speaking to NPCs who may offer extra items or dialogue triggered by high Pikachu friendship.

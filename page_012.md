## Battle Strategy: Type Advantages

### Objective
Maximize your odds of winning each battle by selecting Pokémon and attacks with favorable type matchups.

### Key Information
- Pokémon Types: Fire, Water, Electric, Grass, Ground, Poison, and more (15 types in total).
- Each Pokémon type has natural strengths and weaknesses.
- Example Matchups:
  - Electric attacks are strong against Water-type Pokémon.
  - Ground attacks are strong against Electric-type Pokémon.
  - Water-type attacks are strong against Fire-type Pokémon.

### Decision Rules
1. When facing an opponent, identify both your Pokémon’s type and the opponent’s type.  
2. If your type naturally beats the opponent’s (e.g., Electric vs. Water), stay in battle to leverage your advantage.  
3. If your type is at a disadvantage (e.g., Electric vs. Ground), switch to a Pokémon with a more favorable matchup.  
4. If you are significantly underleveled (the opponent is 20+ levels higher), consider strategic switching or using status moves regardless of type advantage.  
5. When teaching new moves, prioritize abilities that cover the Pokémon’s weaknesses or enhance its existing advantages.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Check Your Pokémon’s Type  
   - Observe the type icon or text indicating whether it is Fire, Water, Electric, etc.  
2. Check Opponent’s Type  
   - Look for visual cues or text displayed during battle to confirm whether the opponent is Water, Ground, etc.  
3. Refer to Type Effectiveness  
   - Compare your Pokémon’s type to the opponent’s type:  
     - “A” means you have a clear advantage.  
     - “D” means you should be cautious or switch Pokémon.  
     - “X” indicates a major disadvantage and little chance of success.  
     - Blank means a fairly even matchup.  
4. Choose Moves Accordingly  
   - If you see a strong advantage (e.g., Water vs. Fire), use Water-type attacks.  
   - If you see a disadvantage (e.g., Electric vs. Ground), switch to a Pokémon with Ground- or Water-type moves.  
5. Manage Experience Differences  
   - If your Pokémon is underleveled, use status effects (e.g., sleep, paralysis) or consider leveling before re-engaging.  

### Additional Tips
- Don’t rely solely on matching types. Even a Water-type Pokémon can learn moves like Ice Beam or Psychic.  
- Balance your team with diverse types and complementary moves to handle a variety of opponents.  
- Keep an eye on opponent level: a high-level Pokémon may overcome type weaknesses if the gap is large.  

Use this guidance whenever you enter a battle to select the most effective Pokémon and attacks, ensuring consistent victories.

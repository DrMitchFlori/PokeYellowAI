## Location: Route 2

**Objective:**
- Travel between Viridian City and Pewter City.
- Explore the nature preserve in the middle of Route 2 to capture new Pokémon and collect items.

**Step-by-Step Actions:**
1. From Viridian City, enter Route 2 and head north toward Pewter City.  
2. Explore the central nature preserve; watch for wild Pokémon in the tall grass.  
3. Pick up hidden items along the route (notably a Potion near the boy standing in the grass).  
4. Collect basic supplies (Poké Ball, additional Potion, and Antidote) if you haven’t already.

**Decision Rules:**
- If facing trainer battles, prepare your Pokémon first (heal and restock items). You cannot run from trainer battles on Route 2.
- If you want to prevent a Pokémon from evolving, press B during the evolution sequence.

**Key Information:**
- Pokémon are plentiful here, so it’s a good spot to build a balanced team early on.
- Trainer-owned Pokémon can be stronger than wild Pokémon. Heal frequently and save your game beforehand.

## Location: Viridian Forest

**Objective:**
- Capture valuable Pokémon, especially Pikachu (in Red/Blue versions), and train your team before reaching Pewter City.

**Step-by-Step Actions:**
1. Enter Viridian Forest from the north end of Route 2.  
2. Search thoroughly for Pikachu if you are playing Pokémon Red or Blue (as multiple Pikachu can appear here).  
   - In Pokémon Yellow, you start with a single Pikachu; no additional wild Pikachu appear.  
3. Catch Caterpie (Dex #10) and Pidgey (Dex #16) to train them toward their evolutions.
4. Gather items on the forest floor (look for Potions and other hidden objects).
5. Engage Bug-type trainers along the paths to gain experience for your team.

**Decision Rules:**
- If you want to train two Pikachu (Red/Blue), evolve one with a Thunder Stone to Raichu and leave the other unevolved if you want to keep a Pikachu permanently.
- If encountering aggressive Bug-type trainers, use Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgey or Pidgeotto to gain a type advantage.

**Key Information:**
- Common Bug-types: Caterpie and Metapod.  
- Flying-types are highly effective against Bug-type Pokémon.  
- Pidgeotto (Dex #17) can be found in the wild or obtained by evolving Pidgey at level 18.

## Duels with Trainers

**Objective:**
- Defeat all trainer challenges to progress through the forest and Route 2 without missing valuable experience.

**Step-by-Step Actions:**
1. Speak to each trainer who blocks the path; you cannot run from these battles.  
2. Monitor your team’s HP and status. Use Potions or return to the nearest Pokémon Center if needed.  
3. Use type advantages:
   - Flying-type moves against Bug-types.  
   - Electric or Rock-type moves (once available) against Flying-types like Pidgey or Spearow.

**Decision Rules:**
- If your active Pokémon’s HP gets too low, switch to a healthier ally or use healing items.
- If your team is under-leveled, consider battling wild Pokémon to gain experience before challenging trainers.

**Key Information:**
- Trainer-owned Pokémon can be higher level than surrounding wild Pokémon.  
- Planning your team composition ahead helps ensure victory.

## Pokémon Evolutions & Tips

### Caterpie → Metapod → Butterfree
- Caterpie evolves into Metapod at level 7.  
- Metapod evolves into Butterfree at level 10.  
- Press B to cancel evolution if you want to keep a Pokémon unevolved.

### Pidgey → Pidgeotto → Pidgeot
- Pidgey evolves into Pidgeotto at level 18.  
- Pidgeotto evolves into Pidgeot (Dex #18) at level 36.  
- Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeot are natural enemies of Bug-types.

### Pikachu → Raichu
- In Pokémon Yellow, you only have one Pikachu (it won’t appear in Viridian Forest).  
- In Pokémon Red/Blue, you can catch Pikachu in Viridian Forest to get multiple copies.  
- Evolve Pikachu with a Thunder Stone to get Raichu.

**Key Information:**
- Pressing B during the evolution animation stops that evolution.  
- Consider evolving one Pikachu (Red/Blue) and saving another as Pikachu for flexibility.

## Overall Strategy

- Use Route 2 and Viridian Forest to build up your lower-level Pokémon.  
- Collect items diligently to avoid running out of Potions and Poké Balls.  
- Exploit type matchups (especially Flying vs. Bug) to clear early-game trainer battles.  
- Plan when to evolve Pokémon based on movesets and personal preference.  
- Save often, especially before trainer battles or tough wild Pokémon encounters.

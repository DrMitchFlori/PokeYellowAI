## Charmander, Charmeleon, and Charizard

**Key Information**  
- Charmander (Fire-type) starts with a flaming tail and can be challenging to train.  
- Charmeleon (Fire-type) evolves from Charmander at Level 16.  
- Charizard (Fire/Flying-type) evolves from Charmeleon at Level 36.  
- Fire-type Pokémon have a strong advantage over Ice-type but are weak against Water-type.  
- In Pokémon Yellow, you can receive a Charmander from a trainer on Route 24 who admits he hasn’t trained it well.

**Strategy**  
1. If you start with Charmander, prepare for an early challenge since Water-type foes are common.  
2. Train Charmander against local Grass- and Bug-type Pokémon to gain rapid experience.  
3. Once Charmander reaches Level 16, it evolves into Charmeleon and gains higher stats.  
4. Continue training until Level 36 to evolve Charmeleon into Charizard, adding Flying-type coverage.

## Location: Cerulean City and Route 24 (Nugget Bridge)

**Objective**  
Defeat the five Team Rocket-associated trainers on Nugget Bridge and refuse their recruitment offer.

**Step-by-Step Actions**  
1. Heal your party at the Cerulean City Pokémon Center.  
2. Challenge each of the five trainers on the bridge in sequence.  
3. Use Fire-types (e.g., Charmeleon) effectively against Grass- and Bug-type opponents.  
4. Switch to Water- or Electric-type Pokémon if you face Water-type foes.  
5. Upon victory, you’ll receive a Nugget. Team Rocket will attempt to recruit you—refuse their offer.

**Decision Rule**  
- If your Fire-type is low on health or encounters strong Water-types, switch to a Pokémon with an advantageous matchup (e.g., Electric- or Grass-type).

**Key Information**  
- A trainer on Route 24 in Pokémon Yellow will give you a free Charmander.

## Location: Route 25 and Sea Cottage (Bill’s House)

**Objective**  
Help Bill fix his teleporter accident and acquire the S.S. Anne ticket.

**Step-by-Step Actions**  
1. Progress along Route 25, battling trainers to gain experience.  
2. Enter the Sea Cottage and examine Bill’s teleporter machinery.  
3. Interact with Bill to help separate him from the Pokémon he’s merged with.  
4. Receive the S.S. Anne ticket from Bill as a reward.  
5. Exit and re-enter the cottage to access Bill’s PC and learn about four rare Pokémon.

**Decision Rule**  
- If your Fire-type needs extra levels before the next major battle, train against local Grass- and Bug-type Pokémon on Routes 24 and 25.

| Venonat    | FEW  | MANY | MANY   |

- If seeking a Psychic-type, look for Abra (noting its low encounter rate and tendency to flee).

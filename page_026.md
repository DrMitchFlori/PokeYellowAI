## Cerulean City

**Objective:** Defeat the Cerulean City Gym Leader (Misty), overcome your rival Gary on the bridge to the north, and prepare for future challenges.  

**Key Note:** A person stands beyond the fence on the northwest side of town. This area is inaccessible until later in the game, so do not worry about it until you have progressed much further.

## Gym Leader: Misty

**Situation:** Misty specializes in Water-type Pokémon. She always uses:  
- Staryu (Level 18, Water-type)  
- Starmie (Level 21, Water/Psychic-type)

**Objective:** Win the battle to earn the Cascade Badge and TM11 (BubbleBeam).  

### Step-by-Step Actions  
1. Train a Pokémon that has a type advantage over Water (Electric or Grass).  
2. Stock up on Potions or healing items before challenging Misty.  
3. Lead with an Electric-type (such as Pikachu) or a Grass-type (such as Bulbasaur) to exploit Staryu and Starmie’s Water-type weakness.  
4. Focus first on Staryu—use strong single-hit moves to conserve HP for Starmie.  
5. Use type-advantage moves against Starmie; beware of its speed and high Special stat.  

### Decision Rules  
- **If you chose Bulbasaur early (or received it in Cerulean City):** Rely on Vine Whip or similar Grass-type moves to handle Misty’s Water-types.  
- **If you have Pikachu:** ThunderShock or Thunder Wave can make the fight easier.  
- **If you started with Charmander or Squirtle:** You are at a disadvantage. Consider switching to a captured Grass- or Electric-type Pokémon before attempting the Gym.  

### Reward  
- **Cascade Badge**: Lets you command traded Pokémon up to Level 30 and enables the use of HM01 (Cut) outside of battle (once HM01 is obtained).  
- **TM11 (BubbleBeam)**: A powerful Water-type move you can teach to compatible Pokémon.

## Rival Battle: Gary (Second Encounter)

**Situation:** After defeating Misty, head north from Cerulean City. Your rival Gary waits on the bridge with four Pokémon in Pokémon Yellow. His team typically includes:  
- Spearow (Level 18, Normal/Flying-type)  
- Sandshrew (Level 15, Ground-type)  
- Rattata (appears in some versions; Normal-type)  
- Eevee (Level 17, Normal-type)

**Objective:** Defeat Gary to proceed across the bridge and face the Nugget challenge from Team Rocket.

### Step-by-Step Actions  
1. Lead with an Electric-type (like Pikachu) to handle Spearow.  
2. Switch to a Grass-type (like Bulbasaur) if Sandshrew appears. (Electric moves have no effect on Sandshrew.)  
3. Beware of Rattata’s quick attacks if it is in Gary’s lineup; keep a higher-level Pokémon to ensure one-hit or two-hit knockouts.  
4. Target Eevee with strong Fighting-type or other high-damage moves to finish it quickly.  

### Decision Rules  
- **If you have Bulbasaur:** Use it against Sandshrew. Grass moves deal super-effective damage.  
- **If you rely on Pikachu:** Avoid battles with Sandshrew or switch to a Grass-type.  
- **If your Pokémon are under Level 15:** Consider training in the nearby routes before challenging Gary and the Nugget Bridge.  

### Reward  
- **Progress north of Cerulean City**: Defeating Gary opens the path.  
- **Team Rocket’s Nugget Challenge**: Battle six consecutive trainers to earn a valuable Nugget before meeting Bill, who can help expand your Pokédex.

## Notable Pokémon and Strategies

### Bulbasaur (Grass/Poison)  
- **Strengths:** Effective against Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types.  
- **Weaknesses:** Vulnerable to Fire-, Flying-, Psychic-, and Ice-type moves.  
- **Evolution:** Evolves into Ivysaur at Level 16, further boosting stats and learning more potent Grass-type moves.  
- **Tip:** Combo typings mean double strengths but also double weaknesses—plan ahead when facing opponents that can exploit Poison or Grass weaknesses.

### Bellsprout (Grass/Poison)  
- **Common Strategy:** Often opens with Growth, raising its Special Attack.  
- **Recommendation:** Strike fast with your strongest move before Bellsprout can deliver boosted attacks.  

### Venonat (Bug/Poison)  
- **Habitat:** Frequently found around trees and attracted to bright lights at night.  
- **Battle Advice:** Use Psychic-, Fire-, or Flying-type moves to exploit its Bug/Poison weaknesses.

## Summary of Actionable Guidance

1. **Gym Prep:** Level an Electric- or Grass-type Pokémon to counter Misty’s Water team.  
2. **Misty Battle:** Focus short, decisive hits on Staryu and Starmie; avoid letting Starmie set up multiple attacks.  
3. **Gary Battle:** Use Pikachu or another Electric-type for Spearow; switch to a Grass-type for Sandshrew.  
4. **Nugget Bridge:** Defeat six Team Rocket trainers for a valuable Nugget and continue to Bill’s house.  
5. **Combination Pokémon Tips:** Remember that Bulbasaur and other Grass/Poison types possess both advantages and extra vulnerabilities—choose battle strategy accordingly.  
6. **Move Forward:** After earning the Cascade Badge and TM11, use newly strengthened Pokémon to continue your journey toward Vermilion City and beyond.

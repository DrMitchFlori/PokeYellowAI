## Cerulean City to Route 5

**Objective:**  
• Reach Route 5 after visiting Bill and return to Cerulean City.  
• Navigate toward Saffron City, but note the route is currently blocked by a thirsty guard.

**Step-by-Step Actions:**  
1. Start in Cerulean City after completing the visit with Bill.  
2. Go to the house in the northeast corner of Cerulean City.  
3. Exit through the backyard, leading directly to Route 5.

**Decision Rules:**  
• When the guard on Route 5 mentions he’s thirsty, then realize Saffron City is temporarily inaccessible.  
• When Saffron City is blocked, then use the Underground Path to bypass it and continue to Route 6.

**Key Information:**  
• You will need a beverage later to convince the guard to let you enter Saffron City.  
• The Underground Path is the primary detour to progress south.

## Pokémon Daycare (Route 5)

**Objective:**  
• Use passive training by leaving one Pokémon to level up at the Daycare.

**Step-by-Step Actions:**  
1. Enter the Pokémon Daycare located on Route 5 before the Underground Path.  
2. Choose one Pokémon to leave with the Daycare.  
3. Continue your adventure. Each step traveled grants 1 experience point to the deposited Pokémon.  
4. Return much later to retrieve your newly leveled-up Pokémon.

**Decision Rules:**  
• When you want to train a weak Pokémon (like Magikarp or Abra) without using it in battle, then deposit it at the Daycare.  
• When you plan to be away for a long journey, then consider the Daycare to passively level up a Pokémon.  
• If your Pokémon passes its usual evolution level while in Daycare, then it will wait for your input to evolve when picked up.

**Key Information:**  
• Cost: 100 Pokédollars for every level gained.  
• The Daycare will automatically teach new abilities but does not allow you to choose which moves to keep.

## Underground Path to Route 6

**Objective:**  
• Travel from Route 5 to Route 6 via the Underground Path to progress south.

**Step-by-Step Actions:**  
1. From Route 5, look for the entrance to the Underground Path.  
2. Speak to the NPC near the entrance who might offer a Pokémon trade.  
3. Traverse the path until you emerge on Route 6.

**Decision Rules:**  
• When you cannot pass through Saffron City, then use the Underground Path to bypass the city entirely.  
• If you encounter a trader who wants a Pokémon you do not have, then remember he will wait indefinitely, so you can return later.

**Key Information:**  
• The Underground Path offers a safe, encounter-free shortcut.  
• Another collector here may request a trade for a specific Pokémon (e.g., Machoke). You can complete this anytime once you have the correct Pokémon.

## Wild Pokémon on Route 5

**Objective:**  
• Know which Pokémon can appear to plan capture or training strategies.

**Key Information (Potential Encounters):**  
- Pidgey (Level ~16)  
- Pidgeotto (Level ~17)  
- Rattata (Level ~19)  
- Jigglypuff (Level ~39)  
- Meowth (Level ~52)  
- Mankey (Level ~56)  
- Abra (Level ~63)  
- Oddish (Level ~43)  
- Bellsprout (Level ~79)

**Decision Rules:**  
• When searching for a new team member that evolves early or has strong upgrades, then consider Abra or Magikarp (trained via Daycare).  
• If you need a Grass-type, then catch Oddish or Bellsprout accordingly (depending on your game version).

### Overall Strategy Tips

1. Use Cerulean City as a hub to rest and restock items before heading to Route 5.  
2. Plan Daycare usage carefully if you want to evolve or strengthen a specific Pokémon without active battling.  
3. Expect to return with a beverage to quell the guard’s thirst and open direct access to Saffron City later.  
4. If you encounter a trade request underground, you can fulfill it any time—take note and come back once you have the required Pokémon.

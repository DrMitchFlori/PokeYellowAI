## Cerulean City Arrival
**Objective:** Gain access to travel beyond Cerulean City by defeating Misty and your rival.  
**Key Information:**

**Step-by-Step Actions:**

2. If your team is under-leveled, train in the patch of grass west of Cerulean City.  
3. When your Pokémon are strong enough, proceed to the Cerulean Gym to challenge Misty.  
4. After obtaining the Cascade Badge, move north to Route 24 and defeat your rival Gary.  

**Decision Rules:**  
- If your team is too weak, then fight additional wild Pokémon before attempting the gym battle.

**Objective:** Investigate the robbed house once it becomes accessible.

2. Visit Bill at the Sea Cottage on Route 25 to trigger the event that moves the officer.  
3. Return to Cerulean City and enter the house, then exit through the back to access multiple routes leading away from Cerulean City.

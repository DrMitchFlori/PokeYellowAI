## Title Screen / Credits

**Objective:**
Proceed to the main menu and begin gameplay.

**Step-by-Step Actions:**
1. When the game displays staff credits (e.g., Publisher, Editor, Designers), press the START button to skip or move on.
2. If no input is given, wait for the credits to finish automatically and return to the title screen.
3. Once on the title screen, select “New Game” or “Continue” to begin or resume play.

**Decision Rules:**
- If you need to reference the staff or special thanks, allow the credits to roll before pressing START.
- Otherwise, press START immediately to expedite gameplay.

**Key Information:**
- Viewing the credits has no impact on your Pokémon’s levels, items, or battles.
- Skipping credits moves you directly into core gameplay actions.

## Route 22 (Optional Rival Battle)

**Objective**: Decide whether to engage Gary in an early battle west of Viridian City.

### Key Information
- Gary’s Pokémon:
  - Lv. 8 Eevee
  - Lv. 9 Spearow
- This battle is optional. It occurs early in the game, and you are not required to travel down Route 22 yet.
- Your own Pokémon should be leveled sufficiently to handle Gary’s team (around Lv. 8–10 recommended).

### Decision Rule
- **If** your Pokémon team is not well-leveled, **then** skip this battle for now. 
- **If** you want to gain experience and are confident in your team’s levels, **then** battle Gary to earn extra cash and experience.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Prepare your party around level 8–10 with well-rounded type coverage.  
2. Head west from Viridian City onto Route 22.  
3. Talk to Gary and initiate the battle.  
4. Use type advantages (Electric or Rock moves if available for Spearow; neutral attacks for Eevee).  
5. After winning (or if you skip the battle), continue your journey if you choose.

## Route 2 Exploration

**Objective**: Capture new Pokémon and progress toward Viridian Forest.

### Key Information
- Common Pokémon:   
  - Pidgey (Normal/Flying)  
  - Rattata (Normal)  
- Rare Pokémon (varies by version): Caterpie (Bug), Weedle (Bug), and possibly Nidoran♀ or Nidoran♂ (Poison).  
- Strategy: Always weaken Pokémon before throwing Poké Balls.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Move north toward Viridian Forest.  
2. Search the tall grass for Pokémon (Pidgey, Rattata, Caterpie, Weedle, Nidoran).  
3. **When** you are trying to catch a Pokémon, **then** reduce its HP to low yellow or red before using a Poké Ball.  
4. Build a balanced team, keeping in mind that Bug-type Pokémon are useful early on against certain foes.

## Viridian Forest Entrance

**Objective**: Traverse the forest or use the Cut shortcut.

### Key Information
- Viridian Forest is filled with Bug-type Pokémon (Caterpie, Weedle).  
- Collect experience for your team before the first Gym.  
- The shortcut around the forest requires HM 01 (Cut).

### Decision Rule
- **If** you want to collect Bug-type Pokémon or gain extra experience, **then** go through the forest.  
- **If** you have HM 01 (Cut) and want to avoid random encounters, **then** use it to clear the bush leading to the shortcut.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Determine whether you need extra training from wild Pokémon inside Viridian Forest.  
2. If you have Cut, chop down the bush blocking the shortcut.  
3. Keep an eye on your team’s health and return to a Pokémon Center if needed.

## Diglett’s Cave and Route 2 Connection

**Objective**: Access the eastern section of Route 2 and optional trade for Mr. Mime.

### Key Information
- You can only reach this side of Route 2 by exiting Diglett’s Cave (entrance on Route 11).  
- There is a house here where you can trade for Mr. Mime.  
- Yellow Version trade: Mr. Mime in exchange for Clefairy.  
- Red/Blue trade: Mr. Mime in exchange for Abra.

### Decision Rule
- **If** you want Mr. Mime, **then** prepare the correct Pokémon (Clefairy in Yellow; Abra in Red/Blue).  
- **If** you are not interested in Mr. Mime or do not have the trade Pokémon, **then** proceed without trading.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Enter Diglett’s Cave from Route 11 to emerge on Route 2 (eastern side).  
2. Use Cut to clear the bush blocking the path to the house.  
3. Speak to the resident inside the house to initiate the trade (if you have the required Pokémon).  
4. Consider adding Mr. Mime to your team for its Psychic-type advantages, noting it does not evolve.

## Collecting HM 05 (Flash)

**Objective**: Obtain Flash to light up dark areas later in the adventure.

### Key Information
- The resident in the Route 2 house will give you Flash (HM 05) if you have at least 10 Pokémon registered in your Pokédex.
- Flash is essential for navigating certain caves (e.g., Rock Tunnel).

### Decision Rule
- **If** you have fewer than 10 Pokémon caught, **then** capture more along Route 2 and Viridian Forest first.  
- **If** you meet the requirement, **then** speak to the resident and receive HM 05.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Check your Pokédex count (must be 10 or higher to receive Flash).  
2. If necessary, catch more Pokémon on Routes 2, 22, and within Viridian Forest.  
3. Return to the house, speak to the resident, and collect the HM 05 Flash.  
4. Teach Flash to a compatible Pokémon for future cave exploration.

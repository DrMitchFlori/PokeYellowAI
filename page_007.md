## General Pokémon Mechanics
### Objective
• Build strong bonds with Pokémon.  
• Use proper tactics in battle to ensure victory.  

### Key Information
• There are 150 different Pokémon, each with unique stats and potential.  
• Pokémon will disobey if they are too high-level for an inexperienced trainer.  
• You must collect Gym Badges to prove your skill and gain higher-level Pokémon’s obedience.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Capture or receive a Pokémon to begin your journey.  
2. Train your Pokémon by battling wild Pokémon and rival trainers.  
3. Earn Gym Badges to increase the level of Pokémon that will obey you.  

### Decision Rules
• WHEN a Pokémon refuses to follow orders, THEN focus on gaining more experience or badges before using it again.  
• WHEN considering which Pokémon to raise, THEN choose one that matches your badge-based obedience level.  


## Hit Points (HP) Management
### Objective
• Keep your Pokémon healthy so they can continue battling.  

### Key Information
• HP measures a Pokémon’s health.  
• When HP reaches zero, a Pokémon faints and cannot battle.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Monitor your Pokémon’s HP bar during each battle.  
2. Use healing items (Potion, Super Potion, etc.) as soon as HP becomes dangerously low.  
3. If a Pokémon faints (HP = 0), revive it with a Revive item or by visiting a Pokémon Center.  

### Decision Rules
• WHEN HP is below 20% in battle, THEN use a healing item or switch to another Pokémon.  
• WHEN a Pokémon faints, THEN visit a Pokémon Center or use a Revival item to continue battling.  


## Power Points (PP) Management
### Objective
• Maintain enough PP for each move to avoid being defenseless.  

### Key Information
• PP measures how many times each move can be used.  
• Using an attack or defensive move consumes 1 PP.  
• Struggle is used automatically if PP for all moves is exhausted.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Check PP levels before and after each battle.  
2. Replenish PP with Ethers or Elixirs, or by visiting a Pokémon Center.  
3. If all moves lose PP, use the FIGHT command to trigger Struggle.  

### Decision Rules
• WHEN a move’s PP is nearly depleted, THEN conserve it for crucial moments or restore it with items.  
• WHEN all moves have 0 PP, THEN Struggle is used automatically, dealing recoil damage—heal or restore PP quickly.  


## Attack Variety & Strategy
### Objective
• Develop a balanced moveset to handle different battle situations.  

### Key Information
• Pokémon can know up to four attacks at once.  
• Overreliance on one move may leave you without PP at key moments.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Teach a mix of moves (physical, special, status) to cover multiple opponent types.  
2. Regularly review each move’s PP usage and effectiveness.  
3. Replace outdated or less effective moves with TMs or by leveling up.  

### Decision Rules
• WHEN deciding which move to use, THEN consider type effectiveness, remaining PP, and possible side effects.  
• WHEN prompted to replace a move, THEN compare PP and power before deciding.  


## Special Attacks & Side Effects
### Objective
• Understand and leverage special attacks that can alter battle conditions.  

### Key Information
• Pokémon have four main stats: Attack, Defense, Speed, and Special.  
• Some attacks (e.g., Bubble) may reduce the opponent’s Speed.  
• Certain status moves (e.g., Confusion) can debilitate foes without direct damage.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Identify each move’s category (Normal, Special, or Status).  
2. Use Special attacks for potential extra effects (lower Speed, inflict status, etc.).  
3. Follow up with complementary moves to exploit the status changes.  

### Decision Rules
• WHEN facing a tough opponent, THEN try a move that causes a status effect before attacking directly.  
• WHEN an enemy is already afflicted by a status, THEN capitalize on the opening with a powerful attack.  


## Status Conditions
### Objective
• Prevent or cure negative status ailments to keep Pokémon battling effectively.  

### Key Information
• Poison, Burn, Paralysis, Sleep, and Freeze can persist after battle.  
• These conditions reduce effectiveness until cured or treated at a Pokémon Center.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Check your Pokémon’s status at the end of every battle.  
2. If a Pokémon is Poisoned, Paralyzed, etc., use items (Antidote, Paralyz Heal) or visit a Pokémon Center immediately.  
3. Monitor HP carefully, as Poison drains HP even outside of battle.  

### Decision Rules
• WHEN your Pokémon is poisoned, THEN use an Antidote or reach a Pokémon Center quickly to avoid fainting.  
• WHEN your Pokémon is burned or paralyzed, THEN decide if you have the items to cure it or if you should retreat to a Pokémon Center.  


## Trainer Authority & Badge Progress
### Objective
• Increase Pokémon obedience by earning Gym Badges.  

### Key Information
• Higher-level Pokémon may ignore a novice trainer’s commands.  
• Each Gym Badge raises the level cap at which Pokémon will obey.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Challenge Gym Leaders in order, starting with the first Gym.  
2. Train Pokémon to a level just sufficient to overcome the Gym Leader’s team.  
3. Earn each Badge to raise your obedience threshold for higher-level Pokémon.  

### Decision Rules
• WHEN a Pokémon refuses to attack, THEN check your current badge count or reduce the Pokémon’s level difference.  
• WHEN you earn a new Badge, THEN confirm your new obedience level and reintroduce any high-level Pokémon to battle.

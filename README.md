# PokeYellowAI

This repository contains resources for training reinforcement learning agents on Pok√©mon Yellow using Gym Retro.

See [examples/train_first_two_gyms.py](examples/train_first_two_gyms.py) for a basic example that demonstrates loading the ROM, computing rewards with ``rewards.compute_reward``, and logging milestone completions.

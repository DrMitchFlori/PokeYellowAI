## Pokémon Strategies

### Abra
- **Type**: Psychic  
- **Key Info**:  
  - Has no direct attacking moves and will use Teleport to flee.  
  - Difficult to capture without disabling moves.  
- **Strategic Advice**:  
  1. When encountering Abra, immediately use moves that cause Paralysis or Sleep.  
  2. Prevent Abra from using Teleport by acting in the first turn (e.g., fast Pokémon or Quick Claw if available).  
  3. Once its Teleport is blocked, weaken Abra carefully and use Poké Balls to secure capture.

### Jigglypuff
- **Type**: Normal  
- **Key Info**:  
  - Sing can put your Pokémon to sleep, making them vulnerable.  
  - Pound deals decent damage once you’re asleep.  
- **Strategic Advice**:  
  1. When Jigglypuff uses Sing, be prepared to switch out or use an item to cure Sleep.  
  2. If you need a Normal-type that can also learn various TM moves, Jigglypuff is a flexible choice.  

### Wigglytuff
- **Type**: Normal  
- **Key Info**:  
  - Evolves from Jigglypuff with a Moon Stone.  
  - Inflates itself to intimidate opponents.  
  - Retains Normal-type versatility for learned moves.  
- **Strategic Advice**:  
  1. When you need a sturdy Normal-type with a wide TM pool, consider using a Moon Stone on Jigglypuff.  
  2. Wigglytuff’s high HP can help it withstand hits in battle.

2. Navigate the tunnel until reaching the exit at Route 6, to the north of Vermilion City.  
3. Battle any Trainers you encounter for experience.  
4. Continue south to Vermilion City once you exit the Underground Path.

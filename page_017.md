## Pallet Town: Rival’s Choice
**Objective**  
• Understand how your rival’s Eevee evolves based on outcomes of early battles.  
• Begin your journey with Pikachu in Pokémon Yellow.

**Key Information**  
• Your starter is Pikachu.  
• Your rival (Gary) starts with Eevee.  
• Eevee’s evolution path depends on your battle performance:  
  - If you lose at Professor Oak’s Lab, Eevee eventually becomes Vaporeon (Water-type).  
  - If you win at the Lab AND win the battle west of Viridian City, Eevee becomes Jolteon (Electric-type).  
  - If you win at the Lab but lose or skip the battle west of Viridian City, Eevee becomes Flareon (Fire-type).

**Step-by-Step Actions**  
1. Talk to Professor Oak to receive Pikachu.  
2. Challenge your rival when prompted:  
   - When you see Gary in the Lab, speak to him to initiate the first battle.  
3. Apply the above decision rules to track Eevee’s eventual evolution.

## Route 1: Heading to Viridian City
**Objective**  
• Train Pikachu en route to Viridian City.  
• Safely navigate and collect items.

**Key Information**  
• Wild Pokémon:  
  - Pidgey (Normal/Flying-type): Often uses Sand-Attack to lower accuracy.  
  - Rattata (Normal-type): Uses sharp teeth for strong physical attacks.  
• You cannot yet catch new Pokémon (no Poké Balls available).

**Step-by-Step Actions**  
1. Travel north from Pallet Town toward Viridian City.  
2. Engage in wild battles to increase Pikachu’s experience:  
   - When in danger of fainting, use Run to escape.  
   - Return home to Mom or proceed to the Viridian City Pokémon Center to heal if needed.  
3. Speak to any NPC you encounter:  
   - One will give you a free Potion to restore HP.  

**Hedge Hurdle Tip**  
• If you see hedges along the path, jump over them only when moving downward.  
• Avoid trapping yourself in hedges by checking your path before you leap.

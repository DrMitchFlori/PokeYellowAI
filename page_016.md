## Pallet Town  
### Objective  
Begin your journey, gather initial resources, and secure your first Pokémon.

### Step-by-Step Actions  
1. Check Your PC at Home  
   - When starting the game, go to your PC and withdraw the stored Potion.  
   - This gives you an early healing item for your first battles.

2. Say Goodbye to Mom  
   - Leave your home and speak to Mom if you need to heal your Pokémon at any point.

3. Visit Gary’s House  
   - Gary is absent, but his sister is there.  
   - If you return later, she will give you a useful item (regardless of Gary’s attitude).

4. Go to Professor Oak’s Lab  
   - Attempt to head north to Route 1.  
   - When you enter the tall grass, Professor Oak will stop you and escort you to his lab.

5. Receive Your Starter Pokémon  
   - If playing Pokémon Yellow: You receive a special Pikachu that follows you outside its Poké Ball.  
   - If playing Pokémon Red or Blue: You must choose Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle.

6. Battle Gary  
   - Gary will challenge you to your first Pokémon battle.  
   - When your Pokémon’s HP is low or it faints, return home and talk to Mom to restore health.

### Decision Rules  
- If you want to keep Pikachu happy (Pokémon Yellow), do NOT trade it away. Trading Pikachu allows its evolution by Thunder Stone, but it will no longer follow you.  
- If you lose to Gary, always return home for a free heal before attempting any further exploration.

## Key Pokémon & Evolutions  
### Pikachu (Electric)  
- Signature Trait: Follows you in Pokémon Yellow.  
- Combined Voltage: Multiple Pikachu in one place can cause electrical disturbances.  
- Evolution Restriction: Cannot evolve with a Thunder Stone in Pokémon Yellow unless traded away first.

### Thunder Stone (Electric Evolutions)  
- Evolves certain Electric-type Pokémon (e.g., Pikachu into Raichu), but not permitted on Yellow-version Pikachu unless traded out of your game.

### Tentacool (Water/Poison)  
- Found in warm, shallow water.  
- Frequently encountered by fishing or swimming.  
- Watch out for its acidic sting attacks.

### Staryu (Water) → Starmie (Water/Psychic)  
- Evolution via Water Stone.  
- Starmie gains a powerful Psychic typing but trades some mobility for size.  
- Staryu often uses Minimize to evade attacks.

### Water Stone (Water Evolutions)  
- Use to evolve Pokémon like Staryu into Starmie.  
- Higher stats and new typing can provide significant advantages.

## Route 21 (Late-Game Access)  
### Objective  
Travel to Cinnabar Island by water route.

### Step-by-Step Actions  
1. Obtain Surf (HM 03)  
   - When you have Surf, return to Pallet Town.  
   - Surf south to access Route 21 directly.

2. Capture or Battle  
   - Pokémon Found by Surf/Fishing:
     - Poliwag (#60, Water)  
     - Tentacool (#72, Water/Poison)  
     - Staryu (#120, Water)  
   - Use type advantages when encountering Water- or Poison-type Pokémon.

### Decision Rules  
- If you lack Surf, you cannot proceed through Route 21.  
- If facing Tentacool, use Electric or Psychic moves for an advantage.  
- If you want a Staryu to evolve into Starmie, keep a Water Stone ready.

## Training & Strategy Notes  
- Always check your PC for early items (like Potions).  
- Return to Mom for healing instead of using expensive healing items when near Pallet Town.  
- Select your starter based on preferred battle style (Pikachu in Yellow, or Grass/Fire/Water in Red/Blue).  
- Plan evolution stones early—especially if you want Starmie or Raichu on your team.  
- Water routes (like Route 21) often open after acquiring key HMs (like Surf).

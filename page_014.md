## Version Differences
**Objective**: Understand which Trainers, Pokémon, and items appear in each version (Red, Blue, Yellow) so you can plan your journey accordingly.

1. **Trainer Indicators**  
   - When you see a circle around a Trainer on the map:  
     - Blue Circle → This Trainer appears only in Red and Blue.  
     - Orange Ring → This Trainer appears only in Yellow.  
2. **Pokémon Encounters**  
   - Fishing or Surfing → Water-type Pokémon often appear only by fishing or encountering them while Surfing.  
   - Color-Coded Availability →  
     - Black text → Pokémon or items found in all versions.  
     - Red text → Pokémon or items exclusive to Red/Blue.  
     - Yellow text → Pokémon or items exclusive to Yellow.  
   - When a Pokémon’s name is highlighted or circled as exclusive to Yellow, then check whether a special task is needed (e.g., completing a specific side quest) before it appears in the wild.  
3. **Item Indicators**  
   - Black Item Name → Usable in Red, Blue, and Yellow.  
   - Red Item Name → Usable only in Red/Blue.  
   - Yellow Item Name → Usable only in Yellow.  
4. **Rarity Notes**  
   - If a Pokémon is listed as “Rare,” then expect a low encounter rate. Prepare to spend extra time in tall grass or fishing.  
   - If a Pokémon is marked as “Not found” in a version, then do not waste time hunting for it there.

## Using the World Map
**Objective**: Navigate the Kanto region efficiently by consulting your World Map (or Town Map) for routes, cities, and special areas.

1. **Step-by-Step Action**  
   1. Open the World Map from your menu.  
   2. Identify your current location and the next city or route you want to visit.  
   3. When you cannot find how to progress, then re-check the Map for alternate paths or hidden routes.  
   4. If you see a Trainer icon, then verify its color indicator (blue for Red/Blue, orange for Yellow).  
2. **Decision Rule**  
   - When new areas become accessible (e.g., you have acquired Surf), then revisit the Map to locate water routes where you can catch rare Water-type Pokémon.

## Tactical Tips for Encounters
**Objective**: Maximize effectiveness in catching and training Pokémon.

1. **Fishing & Surfing**  
   - When you enter a water area, decide whether to use the Fishing Rod or Surf based on which Pokémon are available in that location.  
   - If you need a specific Water-type Pokémon, then check version exclusivity before using your rod or Surfing to save time.  
2. **Preparing Your Team**  
   - Before battling a Gym or encountering a special Trainer, ensure your party covers multiple types so you can adapt to each opponent’s Pokémon.  
   - If facing Team Rocket in Yellow, then expect different Pokémon from their Red/Blue teams and plan accordingly (e.g., bring Psychic-types to counter Poison-type Pokémon).  
3. **Early Item Usage**  
   - When you find Potions in all versions (item name in black), then consider stocking up early to avoid frequent Pokémon Center visits.  
   - If you locate an exclusive Yellow-only item (item name in yellow), then prioritize grabbing it for potential storyline or quest advantages.

## Battle Preparation & Strategy
**Objective**: Enter battles with the right Pokémon and items for your version of the game.

1. **Step-by-Step Action**  
   1. Review the opponent Trainer’s icon color to confirm which version’s roster they likely use.  
   2. If the Trainer is Yellow-exclusive, then expect Pokémon not found in Red/Blue.  
   3. Select Pokémon in your party that have type advantages or resistances.  
   4. Stock up on healing items (in black text) to ensure they work in your version.  
2. **Decision Rules**  
   - When encountering a rare Pokémon (rated “Rare” or with a low encounter rate), then prepare additional Poké Balls and status-inducing moves (sleep or paralysis) for higher catch rates.  
   - If you see an item or Pokémon name in red text, then ignore it if you are playing Yellow—it won’t appear in your game.

## Viridian City

### Objective
• Deliver Prof. Oak’s Parcel and unlock the road north  
• Stock up on items at the Pokémon Mart  
• Heal and manage Pokémon at the Pokémon Center  
• Obtain the Town Map from Gary’s sister  

### Step-by-Step Actions

1. Upon arriving in Viridian City, speak with the Pokémon Mart clerk.  
2. Accept the special delivery request (Oak’s Parcel) to take back to Pallet Town.  
3. Return to Prof. Oak and give him the Parcel.  
4. Receive the Pokédex from Prof. Oak.

6. Go back to Viridian City; the grumpy old man blocking the road north will now be gone.  

### Decision Rules
• If the old man is blocking the road, then you must deliver Oak’s Parcel first.  
• If you need to heal Pokémon, then visit the Pokémon Center.  
• If you want to buy or sell items, then visit the Pokémon Mart (stock changes by game version).  

### Key Information

## Pokémon Center Services

### Objective
• Restore Pokémon HP and status conditions  
• Access PC storage and Cable Club  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Speak to the nurse to fully heal and cure all Pokémon for free.  
2. Use the PC to:  
   - Deposit/withdraw Pokémon (Professor Oak’s PC tracks Pokémon data).  
   - Store extra items (your personal PC).  
   - Check a mysterious “Someone’s” PC (eventually revealed in-game).  
3. If linking with another player, head to the Cable Club area to trade or battle.  

### Decision Rule
• If your party is low on HP or afflicted by Poison, Sleep, etc., then go directly to a Pokémon Center to heal for free.  

### Key Information
• Services are available 24/7 in most major cities.  
• Evaluating progress via Professor Oak’s PC can provide feedback on your Pokédex completion.

### Decision Rule
• If you want to progress beyond Viridian City, then you must eventually return here after specific in-game events.

3. If you have HM01 (Cut), then cut the bush near the person who gifts Dream Eater (TM42).  

### Decision Rule

### Key Information
• Dream Eater (TM42) is a powerful move that restores HP if the target is asleep.  
• Route 2 leads to Viridian Forest and onward to Pewter City.

## Poliwag (Pokédex #60)

### Type
• Water  

### Notable Traits
• Poliwag has newly grown legs and no arms, making walking difficult.  
• Evolves into Poliwhirl → Poliwrath (via Water Stone) or Politoed (in later games).  

### Strategy Tip
• Early-game Water-type Pokémon can be useful against Rock-, Ground-, or Fire-type opponents.  
• Poliwag’s Speed and Water moves can provide an advantage in the first few Gyms if leveled properly.

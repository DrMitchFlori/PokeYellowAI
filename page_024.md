## Mt. Moon Exit (Team Rocket Battle)

**Objective**  
Defeat the Team Rocket duo near the exit to Mt. Moon and claim a Pokémon Fossil.

**Key Information**  
- In Pokémon Yellow, Jessie and James demand you hand over the Fossil before you can exit.  
- They use the following party:  
  - Ekans (Level 14)  
  - Meowth (Level 14)  
  - Koffing (Level 14)  
- Psychic-type moves (e.g., Butterfree’s Confusion) work well against their Poison-type Pokémon.  

**Step-by-Step Actions**  
1. When preparing your party, include a Pokémon with a Psychic-type attack to handle Ekans and Koffing quickly.  
2. Use focused attacks on Meowth if you need to take it out first (it can be feisty and fast).  
3. Heal between each Pokémon if necessary—bring Potions to sustain your team.  
4. Once you defeat Jessie and James, choose one of the two Fossils. If you cannot decide, pick either without worry—both have value later.  

**Decision Rule**  
- If you want a Pokémon with strong defensive stats later (Kabuto → Kabutops), pick the Dome Fossil.  
- If you prefer a Pokémon with a balanced mix of defense and special attack (Omanyte → Omastar), pick the Helix Fossil.

## Route 4 (Post–Mt. Moon)

**Objective**  
Travel safely to Cerulean City and collect important items along the way.

**Key Information**  
- Route 4 has no additional trainers to battle.  
- You can encounter wild Pokémon in a small grassy area.  
- There is a one-way ledge leading into Cerulean City.  
- TM04 (Whirlwind) can be found here.  

**Step-by-Step Actions**  
1. When you exit Mt. Moon, explore the immediate area to find TM04 (Whirlwind).  
2. Collect any hidden items and search for wild Pokémon if you need more training.  
3. When you are ready, jump the ledge to enter Cerulean City, but remember you cannot go back once you do.  

**Decision Rule**  
- If you want to train more before challenging Misty, then remain on Route 4 and battle wild Pokémon.

## Wild Pokémon on Route 4

**Objective**  
Catch or train against Pokémon to strengthen your team.

**Key Information (Pokémon Availability)**  
- Rattata (various levels): Common  
- Spearow (various levels): Common  
- Ekans (various levels): Uncommon (in certain versions)  
- Sandshrew (various levels): Uncommon (in certain versions)  
- Mankey (various levels): None in some versions, possible in others  

**Step-by-Step Actions**  
1. When looking to build a balanced team, consider catching a Spearow for a reliable Flying-type attacker.  
2. If you need a Fighting-type advantage (for Normal-type opponents), then capture Mankey if it appears.  
3. Train your Pokémon to suitable levels here before moving on to Cerulean City and the Gym battle with Misty.  

**Decision Rule**  
- If you need a Poison-type counter, then use a Pokémon that knows Psychic moves or catch a Pokémon with high Attack stat to sweep through Poison-types quickly.

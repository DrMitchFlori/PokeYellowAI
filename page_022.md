## After Receiving the Boulder Badge

### Objective
• Advance through Route 3 to face multiple Trainers.  
• Capture new Pokémon to strengthen your team.  
• Prepare for upcoming challenges by stocking up on crucial items.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Leave Pewter City once you have the Boulder Badge in hand.  
2. Purchase extra Poké Balls at the Poké Mart before entering Route 3.  
3. Battle each of the eight Trainers along Route 3 to gain experience.  
4. Use type advantages when facing your opponents to secure faster victories.  
5. Capture any desired wild Pokémon on Route 3 to expand your roster.

### Decision Rules
• If your team is low on health during battles, then use Potions or return to the Pokémon Center.  
• If you spot a Pokémon you want (e.g., Mankey for Fighting-type coverage), then throw a Poké Ball after weakening it.

### Key Information
• Eight Trainers on Route 3 will seek to battle you.  
• Winning these battles raises your Pokémon’s levels and overall strength.  
• Wild Pokémon on Route 3 include:  
  - #16 Pidgey (Normal/Flying)  
  - #19 Rattata (Normal)  
  - #21 Spearow (Normal/Flying)  
  - #27 Sandshrew (Ground; only in Yellow/Blue)

## Pokémon Center (Route 3 Vicinity)

### Objective
• Heal your team.  
• Decide whether to purchase a Magikarp from the traveling salesman.

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Upon reaching the Pokémon Center near Route 3, talk to the traveling salesman.  
2. Evaluate your finances: consider that Magikarp can be caught for free later, but buying one now offers an early Water-type option.  
3. Heal your Pokémon to full strength before moving on to Mt. Moon.

### Decision Rules
• If you need a powerful Water-type attacker sooner in the game, then buy the Magikarp.  
• If you prefer to save money for other items, then wait to catch Magikarp for free later.

### Key Information
• Magikarp evolves into Gyarados, a formidable Water/Flying-type.  
• You can only purchase Magikarp here in this unique opportunity.

## Mt. Moon

### Objective
• Explore the caves to find new Pokémon and items.  
• Thwart Team Rocket’s plan to steal Pokémon fossils.  

### Step-by-Step Actions
1. Enter Mt. Moon with a supply of Potions and Poké Balls.  
2. Engage (or avoid) wild Pokémon as you navigate the tunnels.  
3. Battle Team Rocket grunts to prevent them from collecting fossils.  
4. Collect useful items and the chosen fossil at the end of Mt. Moon.

### Decision Rules
• If you encounter Geodude, then use Water- or Grass-type moves for a quick victory.  
• If your Electric-type Pokémon is active, then switch it out, as Electric moves do not affect Ground/Rock-types.  
• If low on health, then retreat to the Pokémon Center or use healing items.

### Key Information
• Common Wild Pokémon: Zubat, Geodude, and Paras (among others).  
• Team Rocket is present and will challenge you to multiple battles.  
• Geodude (#74, Rock/Ground):  
  - Often mistaken for a rock.  
  - Weak to Water and Grass.  
  - Immune to Electric-type attacks; resistant to Rock-type moves.
